						<p>Alumnus Update: <a href="http://www.lukasvandaele.net/" target="_blank">Lukas Van Daele</a> has worked on Mirror's Edge Catalyst as a level designer at <a href="http://www.dice.se/" target="_blank">EA DICE</a>
 in Sweden. It all started when Lukas created a Mirrors Edge mod (see 
below) during his summer holiday (DAE-ers never rest!) and that got 
spotted by the people at DICE. Lukas was invited to come to Sweden and 
that resulted in an internship where he first worked on Battlefield 3. 
We interviewed him on his latest work: Mirror's Edge Catalyst.</p>
<p>The last 5 years you worked on Mirror’s Edge Catalyst, what’s it been like to work in such a big production?</p>
<p>5 years is a really long time so you can expect there to be some 
bumps in the road, you need to have determination to meet the challenges
 head on and stick with it till the very end. After all the prototypes, 
tests and reworks that were necessary in our journey to reach quality 
I’ve got to say it was very rewarding to see it through from beginning 
to end. This was the first project I’ve worked on through a full dev 
cycle, rather than just helping out towards the end of production, and 
as a newcomer to the game dev industry that kind of insight was 
invaluable.</p>
<p>The number 1 challenge of working in a big production is 
communication and I don’t see that mentioned quite often enough. Game 
dev is a social job, especially as a designer since you need to 
communicate your designs across disciplines, over various different 
iterations. You need to be able to deal with all kinds of different team
 setups and personalities while you’re dealing with the stress of 
deadlines. Somehow you have to pull it off without rubbing anyone the 
wrong way. At the same time those interactions are what make this job 
fun, there’s so much to learn when there’s so much talent around!</p>
<p>What were you responsible for in this game? Which tools did you use, what does it take?</p>
<p>I was responsible for shaping 1 of the 4 open world districts in the 
game, Downtown, as well as most of the main- and side-missions that take
 part in it. Besides that, I also designed all 4 gridNodes (movement 
puzzle missions). Deliverables included the geometry and layout of the 
open world and mission buildings as well as all of the gameplay 
scripting and cinematic events. I used the latest version of EA’s 
Frostbite Engine, Photoshop and somewhat less interesting... Word. You’d
 be surprised how much documentation is necessary to keep everyone 
informed on the ever changing designs.</p>
<p>Can you tell us something about the pipeline?</p>
<p>After a detailed document explaining all of the events and how long 
they’re roughly expected to take (the beats of the level), we whitebox a
 level using a mix of Maya and our in-editor modelling tool “CSG”, 
similar to Unreal’s BSP. The designer scripts all of the events and 
combat scenarios with a visual scripting tool and then those are 
playtested.</p>
<p>The buildings in Mirror’s Edge Catalyst are built using part CSG for 
the rough shape and then we fill them in with 3D modules and bigger 
detail objects. Just the building shape alone without any gameplay or 
detail props ended up anywhere between 50-200 objects which took a hefty
 toll on performance so we requested a custom tool to be built by EA 
Guildford’s Frostbite Team to merge these objects into one mesh to get 
better real-time performance. At any time we could un-merge a building, 
edit it and re-merge it again which allowed us incredible flexibility. 
So perhaps surprisingly each single building in the game was uniquely 
hand-assembled rather than auto-generated or placed from a selection of 
premade buildings.</p>
<p>Instead of working in the single level (!) that was the city of 
Glass, the city was split up in zones and prefabs so you usually worked 
inside a building block prefab to iterate on gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

			</div>
					<div>
<p>Which steps have to be completed before your level is approved for the game?</p>
<p>We work according to a schedule that splits up the game into 
different phases, finally leading up to the alpha &amp; beta release. We
 strive to get levels up and running as early as possible and then have a
 constant iteration process for those levels with sign offs after each 
phase.</p>
<p>The levels are playtested by the whole dev team on a rotation to get a
 feeling for the gameplay and we skim through the feedback and make 
changes accordingly. After certain phases the game is also tested 
externally with focus groups and we receive detailed reports with 
actions based off those. For Mirror’s Edge Catalyst specifically, the 
Level Design team also had weekly meetings in a less formal “living 
room” with a couch and big tv where we tested each other’s levels and 
gave feedback. Since we had an Open Beta we also skimmed the forums for 
feedback to act on.</p>
<p>Besides playtests that concern the fun factor we also have an 
internal QA team at DICE and an external one at EA Romania that test the
 game for bugs. Those end up in our bug database under the supervision 
of the development director who makes sure we’re tracking well towards 
release.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while there’s definitely phases and deadlines that 
need to be respected the whole process is fairly flexible under the 
agile development umbrella. A level just goes through constant iteration
 loops under the supervision of a lead level designer who makes sure the
 quality and technical challenges are met according to schedule. In the 
end the fun factor is what determines which parts of a level make it and
 which end up getting reworked before we ship the game, as such a 
definitive approval or when we call something done can be somewhat of a 
gut feeling.</p>
<p>Do you have a lot of creative freedom to introduce your own touch?</p>
<p>Even though the Mirror’s Edge Catalyst team at DICE grew to a size of
 100+ it started off very small. In the beginning, on the design side, 
it was just me and a senior level designer doing all of the level 
concepting work. Considering the game was in development over a long 
period of time with only a ramp up of the team towards the end the 
amount of influence we had was enormous.</p>
<p>We got a story outline from the Narrative Director and then adapted 
that to some rough level outlines with events and gameplay scenarios. A 
certain level could be limited by needing to adhere to a certain tone or
 archetype (stealthy, combat focused, puzzle, …) to make sure the game 
as a whole felt varied and offered a contrasting experience between 
levels. But beyond that our imagination was the limit while working 
within those restrictions.</p>
<p>Since the gameplay in a Mirror’s Edge game comes from the actual 
environment it meant that us level designers, in collaboration with 
level &amp; concept artists, were also responsible for a lot of the 
placement of props and general shapes of the environment. You start off 
with a very rough blockout and after much back and forth between the art
 direction and level design you end up with a level that is fun and 
looks unique. It takes the right mentality to work in this kind of 
setup, sometimes you need to stick to your guns and sometimes you need 
to know when to compromise. It can be challenging at times but this 
clash of form and function is where paper layouts turn into amazing 
levels.</p>
<p>In short, as a level designer you’re expected to work with a lot of 
limitations that come from technical or artistic sides and it’s your job
 to make sense of those and turn all aspects into a cohesive experience.
 A lot of the creative freedom comes from how far you can stretch those 
barriers and how you deal with the challenges you face.</p>
<p>What’s life like in Sweden?</p>
<p>The cold and dark days during winter took some getting used to as 
well as the total opposite in the summer where you never see the stars 
at night! Stockholm itself is a really nice city with beautiful 
architecture and cliffs near the water, you needn’t look long to find a 
postcard view. There are lots of green zones in the city and if you take
 the boat for an hour you’ll find plenty of small islands towards the 
sea that are perfect for a summer getaway. Sweden’s very clean and 
environmentally friendly, I don’t even own a car because the public 
transport is so convenient and punctual! On the professional side of 
things Stockholm is also a Game Dev’s dream since there are plenty of 
other studios, startups and talent around besides DICE.</p>
<p>Are you already busy working on a new project?</p>
<p>Absolutely, after Catalyst and taking some time off to clear my head 
I’ve helped a bit on Battlefield 1’s campaign but after all of the 
single player design I wanted to broaden my expertise in the multiplayer
 field as well. While I can’t exactly divulge what we’re working on at 
DICE at the moment, I can say I’m working as a multiplayer level 
designer on one of the biggest titles Electronic Arts will bring to 
market</p>
