         It has been 8 years since ME was launched. Now here we are, 
ME:C. It is a really really long time for a game, because of long time, 
you can not know if it is going to sell well, when you launched new 
version of the game especially for a reboot/prequel . Battlefield has a 
lot of fans, so DICE knew it would sell very well. Despite of that, I 
think the team made a good job. I do not say ME:C is awesome but at 
least, it is good. ( I am a big fan of ME, by the way) Yes, story was 
not as we expected, there are so many gaps that we don't understand, 
also it was too short. Story could have been more detailed and also they
 could introduce characters in game with cutscenes instead of web site 
articles. November riot flashbacks were not enough. We needed more 
detail about it, we can read web site articles but it should have been 
in game. If ME:C used another engine which has worse graphics than 
frosbite 3, people started to grumple. Frosbite 3 is a great engine for 
ME:C despite of some texture, optimization ( for PC) issues in ME:C. (I 
don't know why engine or game has these problems.) Making a open world 
game is not a easy thing to do. If you just focus on main story, it is 
not right. Main story missions, delivery missions, side missions, small 
elements (but has great effects on game) like recordings, dashes, time 
trials, hackable bilboards, gridleaks, exc... These are parts of the 
game, I am not pleased for rush story either but we must think them as a
 whole. These are not easy thing to do. And the game was already 
released, so, discussing will bring us nowhere. I think something went 
wrong while they developing the game ( as you know, game was delayed two
 times), so it explains rush story. Wish, the team delayed the game more
 than several months, thus they could focus on story. But it did not 
happen, so it is time to wait for a sequel and enjoying and accept ME:C.
 All in all, I loved the game despite of short main story because I am a
 big fan and I must look on the bright side, ME:C could have been never 
existed.

 I hear you. It seems like Catalyst certainly had development issues and
 it simple came down to the company pushing out a minimal viable product
 hoping for maximum profit to at least break even for such an extended 
development time to recover investment. Lucky for them, Mirror's Edge 
has a diehard fan base and will buy anything pushed out no matter how 
lackluster it is. Low risk- high reward probability was the mentality if
 I had to guess.

         Aftef finishing the main story, I think this need a bit more 
time to develop, I played worse than this, most graphic issues and 
falling through floors. This seems to be a passion project of a few key 
people, and EA seems to stand more behind the bigger FPS franchise, I 
think they do wanna diverse, and i do see them trying, the open world 
was great IMO, but felt empty at parts. I had a few moments where it 
really felt like a tribute to the first, places named after levels, from
 the first, similar missions, etc. I am not disappointed in this at all,
 I had fun, and will continue to run around the world. I even theorized 
how this could connect to the first game story wise, perhaps i right 
fanfic of it. I sure hope theirs more, as this is a special world and 
should remain that way. I do like the lack of gun aspect,, was a nice 
change and made it challenging, but ai at some points felt the "dumb 
henchman" syndrome. Solar Feilds was also special, it wouldn't be the 
same without him. Good effort guys, please fix the glitches, and keep 
faith running. Please add the slat sound when faith falls off a building
 to street level that was so heart wringing it made you not want to do 
it.

          <br clear="none">There's zero customization within the game. I
 can't change Faith's shoes or unlock any outfits, I can't play as any 
other character, it may be open world but the game is still linear. All 
side missions are either going to point A to point B or finding 
something randomly in the world (security chips, documents etc.) And 
there are no maps for any of it but the glypths. The game limits you to 
unoccupied rooftops. No street level running? Eh, fine but where the 
**** is the life of the city?

        </blockquote> Then this clearly isn't a game for you. If you're 
looking for customization, variants of gameplay, different characters, 
then you're clearly in no position to review this game because you are 
no better than those IGN "critics" who review a game they wouldn't like 
no matter how good it is. From how you are complaining about mirrors 
edge (aside from your Xbox one performance) you wouldn't like the first 
mirrors edge at all. In that case, you should get off of the forums, get
 on with your life, and play a different game.

         Xbox One version seems to have serious issues. I played on PS4

 Failed response. I'm a massive Mirror's Edge fan and also do parkour. I
 played the original, beat it, loved it and even unlocked every 
achievement for it. Catalyst is OK but not a great game by any stretch. 
You across as a typical blind fanboy who will violently defend a sub par
 game unfortunately. Wish you had something to actually say.

 Yeah, I guess xbox one got the bad end version of Catalyst. I began to 
soak in the environment of Catalyst after beating the game and 
continuing with side missions. The details and life of Glass is simply 
awful.

background present, enemies are slow and AI is lacking, marketing was 
deceitful when saying the entire city was available and it was open 
world, skill tree was pathetic making it unnecessary, missions had no 
impact in the world, etc.
        <br clear="none"> So yeah, all who play the game are in a 
position to criticise, because the core game is the same in all 
platforms. Also, if a company wants to release a game in several 
platforms, it's their job to make it run as best possible on all of 
them, and considering we have far better games in terms of performance 
on them, including Dice's own Battlefield 4 and SW Battlefront, that use
 the same engine, then it's the dev team's absolute fault that the final
 product runs as bad as it does, not the particular choice of hardware.
        <br clear="none"> Also, gameplay on PC (at least at launch) showed terrible performance as well, so...

 We all need to support Catalyst or else this will be the actual end of 
the Mirror's Edge franchise. Catalyst was a second chance for Mirror's 
Edge. EA won't give it another chance unfortunately. The best we can do 
is buy it, enjoy what's there, while pointing out the flaws which will 
hopefully be fixed in the next installment (if there is one).

         First I'd want to apologise for my mistakes in writing in 
english (it's not my mother language). I've been looking through the 
forums, trying to find some response from DICE to the problems faced by 
the XONE users and MEC gamers in general. I'm also a great fan of the 
original X360 ME, 100% achievements and more than sixty hours played. 
Loved the gameplay, story, world, characters, music etc, a 9/10. I was 
very anxious for MEC since it was announced (4 years ago??), and i was 
following every bit of information and video released, and i was very 
excited by the quality showed by DICE. Now I have played more than 54 
hours on the XONE version of Catalyst, acquiring also 100% achievement 
but disappointed. ME:C for me is a 8/10 game, but i'm biased because i'm
 a fan, i think the proper note is what Metacritic is showing 7/10.

        <br clear="none">Positive points
        <br clear="none"> 1. Beautiful cinematics
        <br clear="none"> 2. Open world without loading times
        <br clear="none"> 3. Great gameplay 60 fps without problems

        <br clear="none">Negative points

 of my time gaming time spent on trying to improve on dashes and finding
 collectibles)
        <br clear="none"> 2. Story could have more depth (there is a 
good backstory when you read the site and the documents, but the game 
could use some secondary missions to further develop some characters - 
Dogen, Rebecca...)
        <br clear="none"> 3. Poor variety of secondary and optional missions (could use other type of missions like skill missions, points missions etc)
        <br clear="none"> 4. Terrible lightining and bad reflections in the world (the game is far, far from what was shown from videos)
        <br clear="none"> 5. Poor texture quality and flickering issues (the ME from 8 years ago in some aspects had better looking parts)
        <br clear="none"> 6. Extended loading times after restart/death
        <br clear="none"> 7. Bad AI
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">Well, I think this is a place to discuss with 
respect and honesty. I'm a fan of the series but i'm not a blind one. 
DICE should have delivered a better product for us (at least console 
users). It is unacceptable that the same company that have made SW 
Battlefront and BF4 so beautiful on consoles, deliver us a so outdated 
and ugly version of a game. I'm currently the only one in my friends 
list on Brazil playing this game, and i'd like to say that MEC is my 
game of the year to them, but it is not the case...not by a mile.

         </div> 
        </blockquote> A blind fanboy? Such strong words coming from an 
Xbox one player. Anyways, I'm actually surprised to see that you loved 
the first mirrors edge but hate this one, the game play mechanics have 
improved ten fold and the "runners flow" is something you can actually 
feel in this game. In the original, (which I loved but it still had its 
flaws,) whenever you would roll, slide, climb, or vault you would 
instantly lose your momentum then you would have to rely on that cheap 
side dash trick to regain momentum. In this game, there is no need 
because faith keeps her momentum as well as uses it to blow through 
enemies and keep moving. In the last game, combat encounters usually 
ended up in disarming a bad guy and shooting the rest with the gun. You 
said that you wished you could customize faith or choose different 
runners to play as, which was not existent in the last game. Tell me, 
what does the original mirrors edge have that the new one doesn't? 
Catalyst has just as much originality, passion, and fun factor as the 
last game considering you will never come across a game with such 
advanced parkour mechanics and a city filled with unique design and 
color scheme such as mirrors edge and catalyst. Your perception of the 
game has been belittled so much because so many disagree with you. If 
you don't see why so many disagree with you, maybe you should read over 
your past comments and consider how hypocritical your view points are on
 catalyst compared to your view points of the original. To add on to 
this comment to sound less hostile, I understand. Catalyst has flaws and
 mistakes just like the last one had, and sadly the game was 
underdeveloped because EA had rushed DICE. The parts where I don't agree
 with you however is the fact how you're complaining based on the game's
 performance on your console. Is it DICE's fault the game could not run 
perfectly on your console? No. The frostbite 3 (2016 version) is not 
made to run perfectly on consoles in general. I've played the game on my
 PC and my PS4 and ps4 doesn't hold up as much as PC. The only issues 
coming from ps4 were little bugs and glitches that PC didn't have as 
much. Criticizing the game itself just because of how your console 
played the game is just wrong. Catalyst was NOT an awful game. However 
considering you and I will not come to an agreement I'll digress.

         To be honest with you, if you see this, im not having a 
personal attack, to anyone on this forum, this is for everyone. but we 
are not in denial, because an opinion is an opinion and everyone has 
there own views. When i first commented on this, i was asking why 
everyone has to be so blunt about saying their views all the time, you 
can say your bad reviews, you're obviously entitled to it of course. But
 i hate how everyone has to just bag it out to the point where we have 
discussions like this one.This discussion is just an overall bad 
discussion and everyone here, is getting protective over it. But if i 
have one more say in this discussion, I'd like to say, Respect other 
people's opinions as there is no wrong opinion, don't say something 
about other people when they are happily expressing their opinion as you
 can not, in any situation, say that they are wrong. I THINK tha 
Catalyst for me is an enjoyable game, thats my view, don't bother to 
counter it, because this is my last comment on this discussion...

        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">They also launched a pro-indie initiative 
recently called EA Originals, which aims specifically to prop up small

        <br clear="none">"First, it is about taking first-time 
experiences that are unique, gorgeous, innovative and memorable, and 
bringing them to the world.

        <br clear="none">Second, it is about supporting small developers
 and helping them make the most of their games. We'll seek a few 
projects each year for EA Originals, and partner with them throughout 
the process of development to marketing to publishing.
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">Lastly, it is about funding, and offering small
 studios a level of security with an EA Originals game. Making games is 
hard. It's a hard business. These developers have taken on the risk of 
developing a new IP, and great games deserve to be played. So with EA 
Originals, we want the profits from these games to go into the hands of 
the studios making them. We want them to be recognized for their work, 
so they can keep innovating and creating, and so the players get to play
 more and more amazing games."
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">If they can do this for third-party, they can 
definitely do it in-house. DICE more than justifies itself with it's big
 name products. Giving 40 people from the studio the opportunity to make
 a little money on a labour of love, is perfectly acceptable, 
financially, and very easy to sell to the shareholders.

PC, but not enough to justify a top tier build. What exactly makes you

that? It's long established, (nearly three years!) that anything

elitists, aren't you? The game looks mediocre on all platforms. It's not
 about resolution differences or rendering issues, it's about how it's 
average in all accounts and did most of the same errors the first one 
did. The city looks dead and bland, level design gets worse from 
district to district, characters look bad, etc. It's not a visually 
impressive game at all and gameplay is not relevant today. I don't agree
 with some here that ME1 was better, but at least it had better level 
design and was a novelty in terms of gameplay. Quite a shame, 
considering there's a bunch of other games on "substandard hardware" 
that look better than this one or any other on PC.
        <br clear="none"> The port of a specific game doesn't limit the 
core elements of it. If AI is bad in the primary version, it's bad in 
all. If story is weak, it's still weak in all, so what the **** are you 
talking about? Everyone is able to criticize the game, because core 
elements are the same, even if visual fidelity is not. You don't have an
 excuse for that ignorance.

label the game as a failure; on the contrary, I loved it, despite its 
problems and difficulties. But I don't think its problems are caused by 
platform. In any case, if the game was built to play on a specific 
platform, it should be good on said platform. If they choose to release 
the game on Xbox One, it should look good and work well on Xbox One.

PC-exclusive hardware, then the makers never should have released it on 
console at all. But they made that choice and because of that, they 
should have built the game to achieve on every platform.

         I don't understand how this is even debatable. If you're going 
to do something, you give it 100%. If a company is choosing to release a
 game on a platform, they should ensure the game is going to achieve and
 be a success on said platform. Otherwise there's no point in releasing 
it at all. I understand they released it on console in order to reach a 
wider variety of players, but in that case, all customers should receive
 the same treatment. Not putting in the same effort to every platform's 
version of the game results in criticism like this. The game gets a bad 
reputation, both critically and publicly, and doesn't sell enough to 
warrant it being on said platform in the first place. At the end of the 
day, they shouldn't have bothered releasing the game on console if it 
wasn't going to have positive results. It costs money, time, reviews, 
effort and often, it costs players who are disappointed and aren't going
 to stick around.

 Sony knows it doesn't have a choice, and is conforming to ensure it's

 their hardware look bad, in a way that took much, much longer during

they're limiting what games developers can do, and publishers aren't

        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">PC gaming is cheap. PC hardware is infinitely 
less expensive than it used to be, and the vendor sale events drive, 
(hi, Valve,) has made RRP irrelevant two months out from launch day. A 
PC isn't something that lives under your desk and requires hardwired 
peripherals anymore. They're increasingly found in the living room or 
the den, hooked up to 50+" televisions, with games played from the sofa 
on wireless controller, no different to how they are on consoles. And 
the days of having to build a PC by hand are long since gone.
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">Console developers know this. Sony themselves 
admitted the existence of Neo is an attempt to halt the migration from

so much. I was there the day the original PlayStation launched.

that generation 8 will be much shorter than generation 7, and that

 but as a customer, I shouldn't have to know the gaming industry. The

 industry may exist due to all the things you mentioned, but it's also 
run on customer satisfaction. If the customer isn't satisfied, the game

        <br clear="none">So why is it something you don't have a choice

 change platform.
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">Now, let's face it - you're here on a developer
 forum, complaining about your experience with their product. You care. 
You're invested. You're invested enough to get all upset and angry, 
vocalise your protests, and hope things will change. Because you want 
them to. So really, the first choice isn't an option for you, is it? 
This isn't a hobby you're going to give up, (ps. publishers know this.)
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">So that leads you to option two - changing 
platform. Now, realistically, do you want to experience this whole 
process of being let down again? No, of course you don't. So the only 
real option you have, is to clue up, do some proper research, and avoid 
being left with a halfway house experience.
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">I'm not trying to be difficult, honestly. But 
this is a conversation I've had so many times in the past. And as much 
as you may want to be disappointed with the way Catalyst performs for 
you, that's down to you and your choices. If you bought a PS4 for, say, 
Destiny or Bloodborne? That's cool. If you bought a bone for Halo 5? 
That's cool. Expecting anything multiplat to run well on either three 
years later? That's a big, big mistake.

         Story quality is not subjective, It's short, generic and 
underdeveloped. Wether you like it or not is not the point. AI is not 
good in the game. Enemies don't adapt to the player, don't do anything 
other than trying to engage directly, they barely chase after the player
 and mostly attack one at a time. The OP does mention stuff that's 
present in the PC version like reflections and such, but stuff like NPCs
 are almost always standing still (except for a handful of runners 
training), drones with weird paths, bad detailing of street level and 
lack of pedestrians and lack of textures in background buildings, for 
example, are present in all versions. The same for pointless activities 
like taking down security antennas, hacking billboards and such that 
have no meaning or impact in the game, or side missions with completely 
**** and unrelated objectives like collecting red grid leaks. That is 
not something limited by the hardware, it's just outdated, average (and 
sometimes bad) design choices. Again, wether you like the game or not is
 not the point. If you like it just as it is, then good for you. I like 
it, but was expecting better, and kind of regret getting it at launch. 
Considering how they fought and marketed a new game that was to adress 
the mistakes the previous one did, it has the same flaws, and falls in 
the same category: nice game, but only recomended at a lower price.

all of them, otherwise it hurts the sales and reputation of the game and
 team. If you can't understand that, then indeed the conversation is 
pointless. Also, considering other PS4 games graphically, exclusives or 
not, open world or not, Catalyst is way below for a 2016 title.

        <br clear="none">Indead it is, and other games suffered from 
that before, especially when the gap between PC and console was way 
bigger than it is at this moment, and there was a completely different 
focus of games from one to the other. However I was talking about this 
particular game, and while AI does what you discribed, it's hardly good.
 The difficulty of the game is not high enough for them to be a threat 
to be feared, flanking means nothing when you can easily push them or 
kick them into each other or run way faster than everyone without being 
chased. They should have more armed enemies, chase you and kill you 
faster, low tier enemies should fight you at least as good as the 
sentinels and escalate from there, and there should be a runner class 
enemy type like in the first game. Also as important, enemies should 
focus on stuff other than hit you, like dodging, getting backup, and 
stuff like that. FEAR came out in 2007 and still has better AI than this
 (well, and better than almost every other game since)

        <br clear="none">What are you talking about? What has Doom got to do with it?
        <br clear="none"> A game should always be launched with best 
performance possible on a given platform, not broken. Catalyst is not 
broken though, I haven't found any bugs or glitches that I remember, but
 it's far from a great performance. I would rather have the game play at
 30fps but with a more stable texture and object rendering than how it 
is. It's not terrible, but it's not consistent and negatively affects 
the experience. Also I didn't meant the game should look the same 
technically on all platforms. It's to be expected that PC version can 
support higher resolutions and effects according to the hardware one 
has.
        <br clear="none"> Considering console games sales are generally 
higher, and that the entire project wouldn't be approved if they wanted 
to make it PC only, then you bet they should make it run better. This 
isn't an issue with consoles not handling the engine well, as others use
 it and works fine, it's about development issues.

         Let's see
        <br clear="none"> A story being underdeveloped and short is not 
an opinion, it's a fact. Being content with it, that's an opinion, and 
I'm fine with that.
        <br clear="none"> The industry doesn't work exactly like that. 
Software and hardware are mutually evolved, but the consumer dictates 
where it goes and how. Hence the complaints from devs a few years ago 
that the ps3/x360 gen was too long and it was holding back new IPs and 
tech. They could easily switch focus to PC but they didn't
        <br clear="none"> PC gaming is anything BUT cheap. A top tier 
machine costs 2000+ euros while a console costs 400, and not counting 
stuff like a decent gamepad which is already included on consoles, or 
decent gaming keyboard and mouse. I could buy a decent PC instead of a 
top one, that would cost half of that but still more than double the 
amount of a console. Even if I wanted to upgrade my current one, it 
would still be more expensive. Obviously, I speak regarding the place I 
live.
        <br clear="none"> PC elitism doesn't exclude one from having consoles, it's just when someone is being a jerk about it.
        <br clear="none"> Coming winter, you're not wrong,but not right 
either. There's a serious chance that some multiplats will run poorly, 
but it doesn't mean it will happen. There's a difference between a poor 
port and one well done. The games that interest me for console are 
exclusives or have been shown running fine on console. Doesn't mean 
they'll be good, but it means they'll run as intended, unlike Catalyst.
        <br clear="none"> Sure we are here to share our views and 
complains, in a attempt to see other points of view and maybe so it's 
taken into consideration when developing new games. We do care. However,
 when not listened, we can of course change platform to one that runs 
the games well, or do exactly what happens all the time, stop caring 
about a particular series or devs and stay away from those. Just because
 we care, doesn't mean everyone has the means to purchase more expensive
 equipment to run a couple of games better.
        <br clear="none"> So, because Doom and Quake were PC games only,
 at a time where there was a completely different market and tech gap 
between console and PC, means that it still makes sense?
        <br clear="none"> It doesn't prove your point at all, I was 
comparing FEAR level of AI with Catalyst one, I wasn't even bringing to 
the table the console port. And since it came out in the early days of 
both consoles and both had way better games later, it just means that 
the game had bad ports. Bad ports is not a problem of hardware. Also, my
 PC at the time wasn't powerful at all and I still played the game, with
 a lot of stuff at medium and low settings, and still the AI was top 
notch.
        <br clear="none">
        <br clear="none">In short, bad ports have more tendency to steer
 consumers away from a studio/company than it has to make them move to 
new hardware. All customers want to support the game, but not all have 
the means to buy high end PCs, so it's the devs job to ensure multiplat 
games run the best possible in a given platform without being broken or 
poorly ported

to do the same with 500-550 euros, with GPU memory limit off.

         Are we really still arguing over this? Delving into literal 
statistics from the last few years? Console games are just as important 
as PC games. It doesn't matter what happens in the gaming industry's 
system, console games should be just as supported as PC games if they're
 going to be released. The game isn't running as well as it should. You 
can say it's because consoles don't last, and PC games are just better. 
But if PC gear is so disposable, so is this game. To really build a 
reputation and succeed, the game needs to be on console, and again, it 
needs to achieve. Catalyst simply isn't doing that on console and the 
fact is this discussion is about the game, not the platform or industry 
statistics.

think twice about killing it's console hardware sales until Fall 2017, 
in a bid to drive consumers onto PC and into the Windows Store 
environment.

 have to pay no one. I get 100% of the profits. Not only that, but I 
also get to slap a massive 100% profit storefront across the customer's

future.

         I can see we aren't going to come to a conclusion where either 
of us agree with the other, but this discussion was not supposed to be 
about the platform. No matter what, the game is performing badly. I've 
seen complaints about the PC game (far more than the PS4 edition, in 
fact) and I've seen complaints about the Xbox One game. The game isn't 
running well no matter what system you're using. It's true that the PC 
edition likely does play better- it's a sad fact, but to be expected- 
but there are still issues that need to be fixed on console. It doesn't 
matter what the overall idea is. The 55 million customers on console you
 quoted still need support. Profits obviously matter, as you've stated, 
which is exactly why those customers deserve a fix. The console edition 
is never going to run as well as the PC because of software etc. as 
we've already established, but it still needs to be somewhat equal. It's
 a more expensive game for console, and it still needs to be at an 
acceptable standard, because those customers are still completely valid.
        <br clear="none"> Now can we please put this argument behind us,
 since we obviously aren't going to agree, and get back to the point of

your points are very valid and accurate from an industry standpoint. But
 the game still needs to run on console if they're going to release it

console... yet again, why bother releasing it if that's going to be a 
problem? You already said it supposedly didn't bring in many customers 
or earn a lot of money, so from a CUSTOMER standpoint, I can't see why 
developers would bother releasing it on console if it was a) going to be
 so problematic for them and b) going to be troublesome and 
significantly worse than the PC version. From an industry perspective, I
 see where you're coming from. But I am the player. And as the player, I

yes, and glitches that have been reported on every platform. It

platform. Therefore, every platform matters.

Please in the future, though, and I say this in the politest way

          <br clear="none">The equivalent of 600 euros here will get you
 a machine that massively outstrips gen8 performance, and will happily 
run Catalyst with GPU memory limit on. Once the 490 is out, you'll be 
able to do the same with 500-550 euros, with GPU memory limit off.
         </div> 
        </blockquote> I'm not really a "lazy devs" guy, I'm more a 
"something seems to have gone wrong during development" kind of guy. 
There are games with rushed ports like they didn't cared at all, but 
Catalyst isn't one, the game works fine. Example of a bad port was 
Arkham Knight for PC. That kind of thing is embarassing and 
unacceptable. I have an issue with graphical fidelity on PS4, as I think
 somethings could be sacrificed to ensure a better, or at least more 
consistent LOD, but my main issues with the game are others I have 
previously stated.
        <br clear="none"> As I said, PC costs are according to where I 
live. An average machine goes for around 700 euro. Less than that and it
 comes with some shortcomings, either in RAM, or in HDD size, or i3 
processor, or whatever. Mine cost a almost 800 euro 2 years ago. I can 
play games without major issues but most don't run at top performance. 
With 1000 euros, it's possible to buy or put together a decent machine. 
It will run games fine, but it will have issues with the more demanding 
ones, and will not run at 4k resolution. Top tier gaming PCs range from 
1500 to 3200 (the most expensive I've seen for sale). It's not the euro 
that's destroying our buying power, it's the horrible economic 
management and lack of sight, and high taxes, but that's a problem not 
fit to discuss in a game forum.
        <br clear="none"> One thing has been brought up and usually is 
in discussions about PC vs console, which is the dumbing down of a game 
because it're release on consoles too. There's no reason for a dev to 
dumb down the PC version because of consoles. as a lot of multiplat 
games, even those that have consoles as main focus, have way better 
performance on PC and allow customization of settings, multiple screens,
 far higher resolution and so on.
        <br clear="none"> A 600 million users for PC is not an accurate 
figure. It has been stated more than once that while there's a lot of 
consumers on PC, most don't have gaming machines, and most of the player
 base comes from MMOs. Exactly because of that devs like EA or Ubisoft 
go for the multiplat route. For example, CD Projekt said that, while PC 
was and will be their main focus, the Witcher 3 would not be possible to
 make if they didn't go multiplat, in financial terms of course. It's 
not like I'm trying to bring down the PC importance, or it's supporters.
 H. ell, I believe some games should be PC only, or developed mainly for
 PC and then ported to other platforms. Stuff like Arkham Knight should 
never happen.
        <br clear="none"> A cheap car is a poor analogy. People who buy a
 cheap car can't afford better, but surely they would like to have 
better. When buying stuff like PCs, consoles, smartphones or whatever, 
it's a bit different. People buy a determined product because of price. 
PCs can be cheap where you live, or be considered cheap by you because 
you can afford it, and it's fine, but you have to understand that's not 
the case everywhere or for everyone. Some people can't afford a gaming 
PC, others can't justify the investment when they can buy a console 
that's cheaper. Then there's brand. I bought a PS4 because I expect 
excelence from their software based on past experience and showings for 
it's future. Same thing for others that chose to buy it, and for those 
that chose to buy an XOne.
        <br clear="none"> Also, what Microsoft did was because they're 
not performing so well at the moment and they seek to expand their 
library to more people by basically ending their exclusives line. To be 
honest it was a d.ick move towards the consumers and especially to their
 fans, and they shot themselves in the foot, potentially killing their 
console at the middle of it's lifespan.

 You suggest the d u m b e s t things. We can't undo combat upgrades. 
The upgrades are built into the game for a reason... they're designed 
for the campaign experience and progression. Everyone playing the game 
naturally upgrades as they become available. The developers didn't 
include difficulty options for the game... another frustration. Just 
stop with your nonsensical advice.

         You can keep from upgrading combat skills, but it's not really 
hard mode is it? It only takes a bit longer to take down enemies. They 
could add more difficulty options that increased the number of security 
on the rooftops, make enemies faster, more armed enemies too and at 
vantage points, more turrets, more agressive alert status. Something 
that would discourage engaging in combat and give a sense of needing to 
use the running skills as best one can to save one's life. Nothing's 
wrong with games with more difficulty options, it actually increases 
replayability.

 I appreciate your response and agree. If they would've sold the game at
 $20 or so price point, it would've been appropriate IMO. I understand 
the business requires them to recoup as much funds as possible for 
investments made and whatever profit. Organized chaos does indeed seem 
to have plagued this beloved title unfortunately. Deadlines is 
understandable for sure... 4 years of development without the core 
talent and resourcing of Dice/EA remains criminal though.

 didn't achieved it's potential. Usually that happens on new IPs, 
especially that release at launch with new platforms, but this isn't 
really the case. Sure they wanted to start over like it's the first in a
 series, that's why there's a new storyline and no "2" on the title, but
 then they did some of the same mistakes the first one had, even things 
that got changed that have basically the same effect (no guns this time,
 but the melee combat and focus shield makes the player more overpowered
 that in the first). To me, the worse thing about the game is that aside
 the main missions and a couple of side missions, everything else is 
repetitive, has no impact in the game or imagination in their concept. 
This is not a problem caused by deadlines, it's a flawed concept from 
the start that settled on a limited number of outdated ideas from open 
world games, while not being a real open world game. I enjoyed the game,
 not as much as I wanted or expected, but I like it, but hopefully, if a
 new one does get made, they'll fix the problems that seem tied to the 
franchise so far.

          Let's be clear, I LOVE Mirror's Edge, but Catalyst was a utter
 disappointment. As an Xbox One player, graphics were horrible, 
rendering was terrible and there were frame rate issues throughout 
gameplay. Constant flickering, glitches and insulting AI also plague 
this game.
          <br clear="none">
          <br clear="none">How the game manages to maintain its fun 
factor is impressive however. It seems like EA/Dice left this game for 
the interns to develop while their REAL talent worked on Battlefront and
 Battlefield unfortunately.
          <br clear="none"> This game has enormous potential to be a massive money-maker but it needs to be respected, given priority and re- imagined.
          <br clear="none">
          <br clear="none">There's no reason why most 4 year old games 
looks and performs better than this game. "Copy and Paste" vehicles 
driving in predictable yet illogical pattern fill the streets. The moon 
looks like a cardboard cut-out. Building windows are nothing more than 
static pixelated images. Character animations are limited and 
repetitive, drones suddenly appear and disappear, while exploring 
rooftops I would glitch through windows and wall and fall to my 
death....the list goes on.
          <br clear="none">
          <br clear="none">Catalyst feels rushed and underdeveloped. The
 campaign is incredibly short, while side missions all remain 
repetitive. This game should rival that of Dishonored and Assassin's 
Creed. Lord knows the company had enough time to do it. It's 
embarrassing that they released this game. I, alone, can give an 
incredible amount of valuable ideas/ concepts and direction, moving 
forward, for this franchise (I would love to, given the opportunity).
          <br clear="none">
          <br clear="none">I hate writing all this but it needs to be 
said. I also filled out the survey the company emailed me ,regarding my 
thoughts of this game, but I wanted to share it as well with this 
community.
         </div> 
        </blockquote> HIGHLY disagree.
        <br clear="none"> The open world plays nicely and the story was 
well written. While I agree it doesnt look as good as it couldve, MEC 
plays better than the original in every way. Better, deeper combat, 
better characters and writing, not to mention actual world development, 
and left plenty of room for more in a future title.

 I never mentioned that the story wasn't well written. I stated the 
campaign is extremely short... can be done within a day. Your response 
doesn't exactly list your disagreements with what I wrote either. 
Comparing Catalyst to 8 year old game isn't saying much other than, it's
 better than the first. Rather, Catalyst should be compared to current 
games.

         I honestly have very little complains, texture popping (most 
likely limitations of the ps4, (30fps with more drawing distance would 
had probably been wiser), the combat system has the solid principles to 
be good, now they just need to improve it if it happens to exist a new 
one, add a move list that applies well and give enemies more tools too, 
the parkour is great, few flaws sometimes, but it´s an open world.

 I hear you, I'm not here to force my opinion on anyone and I never did.
 I created this topic for the MEC team because I'm a day one customer 
who felt compelled to express my frustrations with Catalyst.

 insult my intelligence, telling me my experience is invalid, insult my

about Catalyst moving forward, is where the problem lies.

        </blockquote> I totally understand. Everyone has a view and im 
sure Dice takes these reviews like yours into a count for hopefully 
future mirrors edge games. Catalyst has its flaws, I notice them every 
time I play it, but I absolutely love it as its one of those unique and 
different games that im extremely good at. Your view may be harsh, but 
harsh is sometimes good and you're doing it good, Dice will hopefully 
look at this and learn from their mistakes for next time to make an even
 better game. Don't worry about people saying you're wrong, because like
 I've said an opinion can not be wrong...

product and then fall a little short on expectations. Releasing that 
frustrations can lead to a wrong idea, especially when it's written, 
that can be interpreted as hateful ranting even if it isn't one's 
intention. However, to those that really liked the game, it's also 
frustrating to read someone complaining harshly about something they 
enjoyed a lot, so they retaliate.

Because here's the thing. Say all textures were at maximum resolution 
with zero lag and the level design was impeccable and obvious. Even then
 - the exact same complaints that are being raised in this thread would 
still be raised. Like I'm not saying it's a perfect game, but jeez. What
 I would criticize are the mechanics and performance, everything else is
 so subjective that it doesn't really matter. Because when someone says 
that their expectations aren't met either aesthetically or story wise or
 leveldesign wise - that is a meaningless piece of information. Like 
literally. My expectations weren't met when mankind sent spaceships on 
the moon. That doesn't make it less impressive.

         I think what Catalyst fails the most is the scenario and the characters.
        <br clear="none"> But overall, the game has quite a strange feeling, in a negative way I must say.
        <br clear="none"> First, right at it's begining, the game feels 
like an old and "mediocre" Electronic Arts game, with this sort of 
"D4RK" side to it ; which is deceptive because the game isn't really 
like that and feels better as the story progresses (I don't speak about 
the incredibly frustrating scenario). Maybe it's just the tutorial which
 gives that bad feeling.
        <br clear="none"> Then, here's my principal wrong feelings about the game : 
        <b>1)</b> the "fake Open World" is quite a frustrating choice ; 
        <b>2)</b> the musics are less memorable than Mirror's Edge 2008 ; 
        <b>3)</b> the voices are not so good compared to the first 
Mirror's Edge (I'm playing the French version), especially the secondary
 characters who seem to come from a 20 years old game ; 
        <b>4)</b> the graphics are less than what I expected (not to 
mention the low-resolution textures charging, the ugly low-poly or 
overscaled models in the backgrounds, the pixelated shadows and the 
massive lens-flare bugs happening sometimes, etc), because they feel way
 too vaporous or empty ; 
        <b>5)</b> the staging and dialogues feels too cliché, like some scenes and situations you've seen a million times in movies ; 
        <b>6)</b> the characters doesn't feel familiar and they are blatantly uninspired and cliché (Noah is a poor replica of Nathan Drake from 
        <i>Uncharted</i> ; Plastic is a replica of Chandra from 
        <i>Perfect Dark Zero</i> ; Aline is a replica of Doctor Mossman from 
        <i>Half-Life 2</i> ; Gabriel Kruger is your average megalomaniac
 villain (not even Breen) ; Faith's sister have no personnality (it's a 
shame because they cared about each other in the first Mirror's Edge and
 they were a simple yet touching aspect of the story) ; Birdman is a 
clone of Morgan Freeman ; Nomad is a **** Emo-boy no one cares about, 
etc...) ; and 
        <b>7)</b> the ending is one of the worst I've seen in a videogame (#1 worst ending ever was Rage for me ; Mirror's Edge Catalyst is 
        <a shape="rect" href="https://forums.mirrorsedge.com/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like" target="_blank">#2</a>
 now). Oh, let me guess ; they will make a DLC to correct that. Why not,
 if it's free or complete enough to justify the price to pay.
        <br clear="none"> So I'm quite disappointed with what DICE made 
with Mirror's Edge after 8 years from the first episode, which feels so 
much more cool and familiar when you play this one (do it and just 
compare, I swear). And I have to admit : I just bought it again (for the
 4th or 5th time in my life ; yes, 3 times on PC, 1 time on 360 and 1 
time on PS3) on Origin after finishing Catalyst ; it was stronger than 
me, somewhere.
        <br clear="none"> Yet, Catalyst is a good game : It's gameplay 
feels more free and more developped ; the fights feels very dynamic (I 
like to beat the **** out of the Kruger Sec. guys) ; the 
"photo-realistic" shaders are nice (on the characters at least) ; the 
city design is pleasant enough (yet the Level Design could have been so 
much more), and the situations are very immersive and intense (Sky City 
was sick). So I'll certainly have fun completing the game at 100% and 
play on Time Trial.
        <br clear="none"> Of course, another disappointment is the 
absence of a Runners vs Security online multi-player, where you could 
create and customize your own Runner. And I tell myself DICE could have 
done that instead of focusing too much on a scenario that turns out to 
be not so good.

everyone plays it in top and impeccable performance even within the same
 platform, so it doesn't even makes sense to create that "what if" 
scenario. Second, people are mainly complaining about performance and 
about mechanics. Third, there's nothing subjective about the flaws 
present in the game. Example: A poor story is not subjective. You might 
like it and others might not, but it doesn't invalidate that it is, in 
fact, poor.

         No, I don't think so. You have just 2 Go for your CG, it's too 
short for "Ultra". I don't have any problem about shadows and background
 are great (even if, that's right, they aren't that good when they are 
far away in the background).
        <br clear="none"> You have typically memory problems, with the 
engine which needs to stream textures a lot of times because there's not
 enough memory, so the lag and low textures resolution on background.
        <br clear="none"> By the way, have tried to uncheck the option that unlocks the "memory limitations due to CG" ? That could help.

         I just found a solution to run the game faster : Set the video 
settings to Personalized and just lower the Post-Process quality. 
Surprisingly, I find the game looks better and clearer with Low, Medium 
or High Post-Process quality. I guess Ultra or Hyper use too much 
Anti-Aliasing, which is the worst thing to make systems lag.
        <br clear="none"> So now I run the game at +40 FPS stable instead of 20 unstable ; and it's much more pleasant to play.

        <br clear="none"> Well, I have to say I enjoy Catalyst in the 
end, but I think there are some things killing the goodness of the game 
AND the franchise, like Faith's look or personnality, the characters and
 the scenario on my side. (I just loved the asian Faith so much, she 
looked so cool... 
        <img alt=":'(" src="49_files/248bc870-b6cf-471d-89b0-9ee0b043e83a.png" name="248bc870-b6cf-471d-89b0-9ee0b043e83a" class="en-media" height="20"> )
        <br clear="none"> Otherwise Catalyst gameplay is awesome and it 
makes the original Mirror's Edge very minimalist. Graphics are great, 
yet I miss the bright white and fresh blue palette or the "Dream" aspect
 of the first game. The Level Design is also too linear. And I just 
wished the game had multiple little things like the sports aspects more 
apparent, character customisation, RPG-Like character improvement...
        <br clear="none"> I think Mirror's Edge Catalyst has to 
represent a solid base, in terms of gameplay at least, for a next 
episode less Hollywoodian, maybe Online only.
        <br clear="none"> I seem to rant a lot about the game in my 
messages, but I really enjoy it, don't get me wrong. I just think the 
characters and the scenario settings kill it somewhere (the ending was 
like a middle finger to me, but nevermind

topic but I'm not sure what to say regarding how "very happy" you are 
with the final product given the enormous amount of tech issues and 
mediocre reviews with Catalyst. Honestly, and I'm not being facetious, 
you really believe Catalyst is on par with the incredible titles on the 
market today? Personally, I was looking forward towards a "Rise of the 
Tomb Raider" caliber campaign and world size. God knows it was marketed 
as such, but what we got was rather... underwhelming, to put it nicely. 
Is it possible to discuss or hint at future development of the 
franchise?

peer-to-peer, the advantage from cable-jacking and lagswitching would be
 so massive, the game would be dead on arrival. And of course, dedicated
 servers require a certain size of playerbase and revenue.

you're describing in a Quake 3 competitive mod I worked on, called CPM. 
Look it up, if you're on PC.

          DICE, why don't you make Mirror's Edge like a sports game franchise ?

        </blockquote> I really don't think that would work. Part of the 
magic of the game is the aesthetic of the city, and playing in a world 
you don't know much about and need to learn. A sports game wouldn't be 
Mirror's Edge.

         The problem would be : Imagine 5 skilled runners. They know how
 to run to be the fastest. Put them on a big rooftop with plenty of 
obstacles to climb, etc. By definition, some runners would have a better
 route, a faster way to the end, so you'd know that to be here or there 
you'll win or lose the race (except if you do something wrong).
        <br clear="none"> The races wouldn't be fun for a long time, and would be a nightmare to design anyway.
        <br clear="none"> More I think of it, more I'm sure that any 
multiplayer play would be fun... 5 minutes, and after that the skilled 
runners kill the game by being the winners everywhere. ME is not 
Overwatch. If you aren't skilled you can't compete against someone who 
is.
        <br clear="none"> That's why un-synchronized multiplayer only 
exists, to avoid this. If you loose against someone that is more skilled
 than you, it doesn't matter, you can train until you can beat "the 
ghost".
        <br clear="none"> A multi like Overwatch or with just races would be dead under a week.

 Racing may not necessarily be the playlist though. Capture the Flag, 
tag, manhunt etc. can be the implemented multiplayer modes. There's so 
much to create off this platform, all it needs is a creative approach.

         It would be cool if you could at least see your friend in the 
map, like as a live Echo, or something? Like a constant Time Trial. 
Maybe they couldn't interact with your world, but show you stuff?
