   <h1>Mirror's Edge Catalyst, Solar Fields Interview</h1>
   <div>
    <div></div>
   </div>
  </div> 
  <p>For years now, I’ve had difficulty explaining to some people why 
Mirror’s Edge is so important. It was a new and exciting thing for 
gamers and at the same time it served as a paradigm for game designers. 
Video games are fun, sure. It’s just fun to shoot stuff, collect points 
and, ya know, the how the routine goes. Mirror’s Edge showed us 
something more than that. Its mechanics were incredibly dynamic, and yet
 it took us beyond the typical action-packed formula. Sometimes taking a
 different road and steering away from trends and certainty is more 
important than experiencing something safe and familiar. Experiencing 
parkour (free-running) in a first-person video game, felt pretty damn 
awesome. At the center of it we had the heroine, Faith, whose character 
and story reached so many people. She is quite simply unique, she fights
 for freedom and yeah, she runs like hell.</p> 
  <p>DICE left a mark because they had the courage to experiment with 
gameplay mechanics that were fresh. They spiced things up with a 
visually compelling ambience and one hell of an electronic soundtrack. 
The music ended up being an essential ingredient that gave Mirror’s 
Edge, well, the right edge to stand out in an ocean of first-person 
video games.</p> 
  <p>With Mirror’s Edge Catalyst on the horizon, we sat down and had a 
nice little chat with music artist Solar Fields to find out more about 
him and what it’s like to be part of such a project.</p>

  <p><em><strong>ActionTrip: Please tell us a little bit about yourself.
 How long you’ve been in the music business and explain a bit how you 
joined the folks at DICE and the Mirror’s Edge project back in 2008. </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>Magnus Birgersson</strong></em>: My name is Magnus 
Birgersson and live in Gothenburg, Sweden. I started composing 
electronic music in the late 80s and have been doing it since then. I 
have also been a part of many other different musical projects, from 
world music to jazz and metal, but the electronic genre is something 
that had stayed with me. Around 2004 I got a phone call from Magnus 
Walterstad, Audio Director for Mirror’s Edge at DICE. He sent me some 
concept art and asked me to audiolize this art to see if I "heard’ the 
same things he did while looking at the images. He didn’t tell me what 
the project was or anything, I just got those images. Having heard my 
demo, Magnus said it was a perfect match and after some months I got 
invited to the DICE offices in Stockholm for a short briefing on the 
project. In September 2007 I started working full time on the music for 
Mirror’s Edge.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: What is it about the Mirror’s Edge universe that you like the most? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: For me it is the whole thing. The 
design, Faith and all the other characters, and the fluid movement. It 
is something fresh to me.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: How much time have you spent creating the Mirror’s Edge Catalyst OST? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB: </strong></em>Right now I’ve spent +12 months, 
full-time on the project, with some more tweaking still left to do. I 
have now setup a temporary studio at DICE where me and Audio director 
Magnus Walterstad can work tight together on the final editing. This is 
really the best phase of the project, working closely to the team, 
seeing everything come alive, and also trying new tweaks directly when 
I’m composing.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: What has been the most difficult aspect of composing music for a game like Mirror’s Edge? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: I’d say getting all the different 
musical pieces for a mission to work together, and to get those to 
reflect the mood and the general atmosphere in the game while 
maintaining a common theme through all compositions.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: Have you been playing the game yourself before creating the tracks? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: Yes, I’ve been visiting DICE on a 
regular basis to see and try the game, and meeting up with level 
designers. During the process, a lot of things can change, so it has 
been important for me to be up to date on the project.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: In the original Mirror’s Edge, the soundtrack 
really did feel like it was a key component to the whole experience. Are
 there any themes you plan to rework or bring back to Mirror’s Edge 
Catalyst or will we hear strictly new stuff?</strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: Thank you for that! I heard that a 
lot and I’m happy that my music has resonated with so many. To tell you 
the truth I was quite nervous when I joined this project back in 2007. I
 had a feeling that video games were like movies, containing more 
classical compositions and that is perhaps not my forte. But DICE told 
me that it was the typical Solar Fields sound they wanted, so I could 
tackle the project with confidence. For Mirror's Edge Catalyst I’m 
working on all-new music. Since it’s a completely new title the music 
has to be up to date and reflect the new story and atmosphere.</p> 
  <p><strong><em>AT: As Faith dashes across rooftops, the running feels 
like it could be endless, and a similar thing comes across in your 
music. There’s a flow and continuity to it, so each track seems like it 
could go on and on. Does Mirror’s Edge Catalyst have the same kind of 
vibe and flow to it, or is it more dynamic, action-oriented this time 
around?</em></strong></p> 
  <p><strong><em>MB</em></strong>: I’ve been working on a lot of 
different musical flows, from really deep ambient, droney atmospheres to
 action-oriented pieces. I would say the music contains the whole 
musical spectrum from just a single note to big walls of sound. All 
without any gaps, thanks to an extremely nice audio engine in Frostbite 
that makes it possible to take the music to a new dimension. We now have
 8 channels for the music that we can mix in real time in-game depending
 on the mood and what’s going on. So, the player’s action will determine
 how the music will be played.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: It must feel great to hear your own music in the 
background while playing a game. But did you ever come across a section 
thinking “Man, I could’ve done this differently”? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: Some small regrets will always be 
there; I think every composer more or less feels this after a project is
 done. But you have to learn how to work and not overdo some parts 
because then something else will suffer. From the very first day I 
calculated how much time I could afford to spend on each musical part, 
and I’ve been following that pace during the whole journey.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: Would you ever consider working on soundtracks for other video games? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: Absolutely, I love to be in the 
studio and compose music so long-term projects are perfect for me since 
then I can put all my focus and creativity on just one thing. I also 
enjoy to jump on new creative challenges so, yes. I do also compose 
different kind of music than Solar Fields even if that is my main thing.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: Do you play games yourself? If so, please name a particular game genre you prefer playing. </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: Yes I am a gamer when the time allows
 me! As for genres, I'm a huge fan of well-made horror games, and also 
games that deliver something new to the gaming experience.</p> 
 </div>
 <div> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: Many great artists and musicians come from your 
country. Hence, the inevitable question: what is it about Sweden that 
drives so many people to pursue a career in music? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: That’s true indeed. I’m really not 
sure about the reason, but I believe it has to do with how the school 
system is built up. You can take musical lessons at a really young age 
and I guess if you’re talented and enjoy it, you will continue.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: What inspires you the most as a composer? Just name
 a few musicians or different artists, if you wish. And, are there other
 video game soundtracks you heard and really liked? </strong></em></p> 
  <p></p>
  <div>
   
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: To namedrop some artists or musicians
 is really hard, I think it is due to that I listen to a lot of 
different musical genres, and therefore have a lot of music influences. I
 enjoy the electronic music from the 90s, since back then most of the 
artists had their own unique sound, which is rare today. I travel a lot 
with my music, so I see new places and people and that gives me a ton of
 inspiration. One memorable game soundtrack is the score for Final 
Fantasy 7 by Nobuo Uematsu – this is a timeless masterpiece. It really 
fits the feeling and mood of the game’s story.</p> 
  <p><em><strong>AT: After Mirror’s Edge Catalyst, what lies ahead for Solar Fields? </strong></em></p> 
  <p><em><strong>MB</strong></em>: After this project I will take a 
short break from music and rebuild my studio. It’s a little messy now 
after 12 month of creative work! A lot of synths and cables are laying 
around and I haven’t really cared about the surroundings in the studio. 
It happens very easily when you are being creative so now it is time to 
fix the mess! I will also start to do live shows again since I basically
 stopped that when I started working on Mirror's Edge Catalyst, since I 
needed all the focus and dedication for that. My next Solar Fields album
 is also in the making. I have a lot of ideas on how that will sound and
 the foundation for it is already made, so that is something I am 
looking forward to work on.</p>
