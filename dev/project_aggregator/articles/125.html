            <p>EA’s iconic games studio is taking a number of big gambles.</p>
<p>It has opened a new LA studio, given Battlefield to another 
developer, it’s trying to re-launch its cult Mirror’s Edge franchise and
 then build the greatest Star Wars game of all time. MCV finds out more 
from DICE general manager Karl-Magnus Troedsson.</p>
<p><strong>Dead Space developers Visceral are taking charge of the next 
Battlefield. Are there many elements from Dead Space that the team will 
be carrying across?</strong><br clear="none">We haven’t started talking 
about single player yet, but yes absolutely. There are challenges as 
well with this new team, too. It’s the first game they have built on 
Frostbite, so using new tools, pipelines and engines. That’s part of the
 fun, right? Learning something new.</p>
<p><strong>Now you have a second Battlefield studio, are you trying to make this an annual franchise like Call of Duty?</strong><br clear="none">I
 get that question a lot. We will make Battlefield games if we have 
great ideas and teams passionate about building them. If that means we 
have games that will suit an annual release then maybe we’ll do that. 
Visceral had been working in parallel with the Battlefield 4 team in 
secrecy.</p>
<p>In the past we made a Battlefield game, people played it for two 
years then they moved to the next one. We’re now moving into a parallel 
way of looking at the IP. We’d be happy if people want to play 
Battlefield 4 even after Hardline is out, because we are going to 
continue taking care of the old games as well.</p>
<p>"We're going to build the best Star Wars game ever <br clear="none">created. The franchise deserves it."</p>
<p>Karl-Magnus Troedsson, DICE&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DICE has perhaps its biggest ever line-up with Battlefield, Mirror’s Edge and Star Wars. How are you managing that?</strong><br clear="none">It’s
 extremely positive but also a big responsibility. One way of doing it 
is by opening up new studios, like DICE LA. We try to look at it as 
diversifying who is working on your games, which is what we’re doing 
with Battlefield. The rest of it is about about when you are going to 
release the titles, how you scope them, how to staff them. All that kind
 of boring stuff that I do in the background.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror’s Edge is one of few games with a female lead. Is that something the team felt was important?</strong><br clear="none">Faith
 is very near and dear to us. We strongly believe in her and that’s part
 of the reason why we’re so passionate about building this game. We’re 
very tight lipped about what’s going on in the game, but I can say that 
Faith in many ways is Mirror’s Edge. Having a strong heroine is very 
important to us as well. And, in this case, not a female heroine that 
we’re stereotypically exaggerate like some other game franchises have 
done historically.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror’s Edge was a cult hit but not a huge one. And it’s now
 six years old. So how do you approach a sequel to a title like that?</strong><br clear="none">We’ve
 done a lot of analysing of the old game. Many people found it very fun 
but very frustrating. We need to make a game that more players will 
enjoy. It’s not just going to be a rehash of the old game.</p>
<p><strong>Your other title is Star Wars Battlefront. What’s it like to work on such an iconic IP?</strong><br clear="none">Historically
 DICE hasn’t worked on licenses that are not our own. So this is 
different for us. If someone came to us with another licence then we’d 
probably say no but, in this case, Star Wars has a very special place in
 our hearts. So when the chance to work on this game came up, we grabbed
 it. But that comes with a different kind of dependency that we haven’t 
had for a long time as we’re working with someone else’s IP. But 
LucasFilm has been absolutely spectacular. Everyone is approaching this 
with the same idea – that we are going to create the best Star Wars game
 ever. ??</p>
<p><strong>That’s quite a statement.?</strong></p>
<p>But it’s something that fits us. At DICE we are a passionate group. 
We always try and remain humble, which comes pretty naturally to us, but
 what people might not know is that we are very competitive about what 
we’re doing. We always want to surpass what we’ve done in the past. We 
don’t shy away from wanting Battlefield to be the preferred choice in 
the first person shooter genre. When we approach something like 
Battlefront there’s only one way for us to think about it and that’s: we
 are going to build the best Star Wars game ever created, if nothing 
else because Star Wars deserves it.</p>
<p><strong>Your Battlefront and Mirror’s Edge E3 videos were behind-the-scenes teasers. Why do that?</strong><br clear="none">It’s
 about how we talk about EA internally, and it’s refreshing that we dare
 to go to E3 and show work in progress rather than perfectly 
pre-rendered trailers, which is what a lot of other companies have done,
 which no-one mentioned. We showed movies that are not about a finished 
game; it’s about the people that made it, their passion, and a status 
report about where we are right now. We want to get closer to the 
players. Everyone works so fricking hard to create great games and 
that’s because we are very passionate about it. We want people to know 
that.</p>
<p></p><div><img src="125_files/221bc53d-cb73-4dbc-aa63-f66675dd484c.jpg" name="221bc53d-cb73-4dbc-aa63-f66675dd484c" class="en-media"></div><p></p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to do these early concept videos?</strong><br clear="none">There
 are several things, from allowing people to buy half-finished games in 
alpha state and allowing them to be part of the development to the 
crowd-funding of games where people can pay to be part of the process.</p>
<p>We absolutely take cues from gamers: what they can relate to and how 
they want to communicate with us. They want us to be more open and we 
will be.</p>
<p><strong>So you want gamers to get involved in making the games?</strong><br clear="none">I
 strongly believe that you can’t design by committee. You can focus 
group-test a good idea to death if you’re not careful. It can’t be a 
democracy where everyone can be part of the designing – especially if 
it’s a new IP. But if you have a long-lasting franchise like 
Battlefield, gamers know what it is and its core values, and if you 
create something like this you can listen to core fans and get very 
valid input as to which direction you should take it.</p>
<p><strong>How have you found making next-gen triple-A games?</strong><br clear="none">No
 development of a game of this size is a breeze. There could be 250 
people involved in doing this and that doesn’t count all of the support 
people in EA that are needed to get a game to market. So it’s a huge 
undertaking. Every platform transition we go through is a challenge from
 that perspective, but when you have taken the plunge and once you have 
gotten over the first generation of your games on a new platform, 
everything becomes easier. It showed at E3 this year. Some people are 
getting into the groove on the new platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Have you had to change the studio’s structure at all?</strong><br clear="none">No.
 The Battlefield franchise has grown and we have a sister studio that is
 helping us build a game which is cool. DICE has grown. We have a studio
 in LA. We built that in order to get the right capacity for the Star 
Wars game. From that perspective there’s been changes going on.<br clear="none">One
 thing that has changed a bit, but isn’t brand new, is that we strongly 
believe that studios like DICE should not work on one franchise. That’s 
been an idea in DICE way back before we started building the first 
Mirror’s Edge. The theory is this: if you bring a group of talented 
people and have them working on a big franchise they can do that for 
several iterations. But at some point these creative people are going to
 be like ‘I’ve worked on three Battlefield games, it would be great to 
try something else’. We don’t want them to leave DICE for something like
 that. We would rather they say ‘Can I go work on Mirror’s Edge or Star 
Wars?’ – Yes, we can sort that for you. Or if you want to you can move 
to LA and get a little bit more sun. We want to create studios where 
people can see themselves working for ten or 15 years or even longer.</p>
