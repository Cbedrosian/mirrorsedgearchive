   <h1>Designing Mirror’s Edge: The making of a franchise</h1>
   <div>
    <div></div>
   </div>
  </div> by Phil Kollar 
  <div> 
   <div> 
    <p>When the first-person parkour game <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> launched in 2008, players reacted with a wide range of emotions.</p> 
   </div> 
   <p>Many praised the unique take on a first-person game, one that 
attempted to perfect movement and platforming in that perspective. 
Others criticized publisher Electronic Arts and developer DICE for not 
going far enough. Most notoriously, the game still allowed the player to
 pick up and shoot guns as a last resort, a mechanic that broke the flow
 and showed a lack of polish.</p> 
   <p>The general feeling at EA seems to be that <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> 
performed fine. It wasn’t a huge failure, but it also wasn’t a massive 
success. And yet, in the near decade since its release, the game has 
stayed lodged in gaming’s consciousness.</p> 
   <p>Maybe it was the unique art style. Maybe it was the sense of 
speed. Perhaps it was the unique feeling of a first-person action game 
that wasn’t primarily focused on shooting, years before the 
narrative-heavy, no-combat style would become a staple of the indie game
 scene. Whatever the reason, <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> remained a 
centerpiece of conversations with an ever-growing, passionate fanbase. 
And more than anything, that fanbase wanted a sequel.</p> 
   <p>Now, nearly eight years later, EA and DICE are finally ready to 
provide that sequel. But before making it, the studio went through a 
lengthy process, with multiple teams pitching their own ideas for the 
long-awaited sequel. A process that itself mirrored the birth of the 
first <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>.</p>

   </div>
   <cite>While <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>’s City of Glass is an 
open-world, players will need to unlock the city section by section. The
 first area is the City of Glass’ downtown. Next, players will enter the
 Anchor District, which DICE’s Erik Odeldahl calls "more demanding and a
 lot more versatile." Beyond that lies The View, a dangerous district 
built for the upper crust of the city’s high society. In addition to 
those three, Odeldahl mentions an area called "The Underground." He 
changes the subject just as quickly, saying he wants to keep some 
surprises.</cite> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <h2>Something different</h2> 
   <p>"I had no idea that <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> was what we were going to end up building," says EA Studios executive vice president Patrick Söderlund.</p> 
   <p>In the mid-2000s, Söderlund was CEO of DICE (a.k.a. Digital 
Illusions Creative Entertainment), a Swedish game development studio 
that North American mega-publisher EA acquired in 2006. Prior to that 
purchase, when EA owned a majority stake in the studio, DICE was looking
 to stretch its creative muscles and remind everyone that it was 
independent.</p> 
   <p>"There was a push inside the studio to do something different," 
Söderlund says. "... At the time that we were still an independent 
company. We wanted to push for a new IP."</p> 
   <div> 
     
     <div>
      <img alt="Patrick Soderlund" src="55_files/b55be694-ea8e-4b43-ac94-79d78e5c9e79.jpg" name="b55be694-ea8e-4b43-ac94-79d78e5c9e79" class="en-media">
     </div> 
     
    <cite>Patrick Söderlund</cite> 
   </div> 
   <p>Up to that point, DICE had made a name for itself first with 
racing games and then with the increasingly popular Battlefield military
 shooter series. Given Battlefield's popularity, DICE was inevitably 
going to continue developing the franchise. But while the majority of 
the studio focused on new Battlefield entries, several small groups of 
three to five developers began workshopping pitches for something new.</p> 
   <p>Over the course of a year-and-a-half, Söderlund saw 10 different 
pitches in various states. Some just had concept art; others had 
functioning prototypes. But none of them were what he wanted the studio 
to pursue.</p> 
   <p>"Nothing really stood out or felt unique enough or different," he 
says. "Whenever you’re in a position to create something new, you have 
to really think about what you’re trying to build, who you’re building 
it for and what you want to achieve. For us, we wanted to do something 
that was different, that had its own place in the market and felt fresh 
and unique."</p> 
   <p>To Söderlund, this wasn’t just a one-time process; he says even today it’s a core piece of DICE’s studio identity.</p> 
   <p>"At some point, in a creative organization, in order for it to 
continue to thrive, you have to challenge people to do something that 
they’re not comfortable with," he says. Lots of people presented what 
Söderlund calls "really cool" ideas, but no one brought forward 
something that actually got him nervous about whether or not DICE could 
pull it off.</p> 
   <p>After over a year of searching, a team came to Söderlund with a pitch that gave him pause: a parkour-based first-person game.</p> 
   <p>"I think my first reaction was, ‘That sounds like a really bad 
idea,’" Söderlund recalls, laughing. "First-person movement, in general,
 is difficult. For you to understand where you are in the world, spatial
 awareness becomes difficult."</p> 
   <p>Erik Odeldahl was new to DICE in 2006 and primarily working on the
 Battlefield series at the time. He remembers the wave of excitement the
 earliest <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> demo caused at the company, though.</p> 
   <p>"I remember testing a white box demo," Odeldahl says. "It was 
basically only first-person movements in a completely untextured 
environment but with fairly decent animations. I remember being 
completely blown away."</p> 
   <div>
    <q>Whenever someone looked at a screenshot of this game, I wanted them to understand immediately what game it was.</q>
   </div> 
   <p>Odeldahl recalls coming up to a wall in this first demo and 
wondering if he could run on it. Without any tutorial or direction, he 
pulled it off, and it left a huge grin on his face. He immediately 
wanted to be on the project, but he had an obligation to the Battlefield
 franchise, and <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> had yet to be greenlit.</p> 
   <p>Söderlund was worried about the difficulty of pulling off the core concept behind <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>,
 but he couldn’t deny that it was a unique idea, something he had never 
seen before. The team was persistent and continued working on the idea 
even without his full support. Eventually it brought it back to him with
 a prototype that included refined first-person movement and the element
 that sold Söderlund on the concept: a bright, hyper-clean art style.</p> 
   <p>"At the time, I remember looking at a lot of games, and they all 
kind of looked the same," he says. "I challenged the team in art 
direction. Whenever someone looked at a screenshot of this game, I 
wanted them to understand immediately what game it was."</p> 
   <p>With an outstanding look, a unique gameplay hook and the 
introduction of a memorable protagonist in the form of Faith, Söderlund 
was finally won over by <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>. "I fell in love with the whole concept," he says.</p> 
   <p>EA revealed the game to the public in 2007, and released it in November of 2008.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <h2>The search for a sequel</h2> 
   <p>To understand why it took so long for DICE to pursue a <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 sequel, it’s important to understand the first game’s level of success,
 particularly through the metrics of a major publisher like EA. Even 
Söderlund couches its sales and critical performance in less superlative
 terms than you might expect from a publisher executive.</p> 
   <p>"The reception for Mirror’s Edge was pretty good," he says. "Obviously, you always want better."</p> 
   <p>Söderlund believes the team that created the first game nailed 
many aspects of what it needed, including the character Faith and the 
general feel of first-person movement. And yet, he admits, "When you’re 
trying to break new ground, it’s difficult to get the formula 
perfected."</p> 
   <p>Some of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>’s imperfections include the 
lackluster story, a controversial, fast-paced movement system that 
needed a little more polish and, yes, the game’s inclusion of the 
ability to wield guns.</p> 
   <div> 
    <div>
     <img alt="Erik Odeldahl" src="55_files/7cfe12a6-9873-43dd-9597-0bc9cb6aeb0b.jpg" name="7cfe12a6-9873-43dd-9597-0bc9cb6aeb0b" class="en-media">
    </div>
    <cite>Erik Odeldahl</cite> 
   </div> 
   <p>"We maybe didn’t dare to go all the way with the product in the 
sense that we decided to throw in weapons, and you could pick them up 
and shoot," Söderlund says. "In hindsight, in all candor, that maybe was
 not the best fit for the game."</p> 
   <p>Odeldahl, who watched the first game's development with increasing
 curiosity inside the studio, says there were discussions about 
potentially removing guns back then. But the team had "a clear design 
intent" when it decided to include them.</p> 
   <p>"Picking up a gun really slows you down," he says. "It’s like a 
counterpoint to the fluid movement. There was an intent there, which I 
think is really interesting. But for this game and for Faith as a 
character also, it didn’t fit."</p> 
   <p>The same criticisms that being discussed within the studio were 
talking points for critics and the public at large in the weeks and 
months after <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>’s release. But there was also lots 
of praise being directed at the game. Amo Mostofi, now a producer at 
DICE, was not working at the company yet. He says that playing <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> for the first time was a "what the hell moment."</p> 
   <p>"I experienced it in the same way, I think, as so many of the fans
 did," Mostofi says. "From the first-person perspective, you’re so used 
to a certain style of gameplay. This just broke the mold completely."</p> 
   <p>Mostofi became obsessed with the game, playing it over and over 
and watching speedrunners who worked to constantly shave seconds off of 
near-flawless runs through each level. It was, much more so than any 
Battlefield release, the game that made Mostofi want to work at DICE.</p> 
   <p>Battlefield, however, was really starting to blow up. Certain 
parties within DICE, including Odeldahl, began pushing for a second 
chance at <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> within a year of the first game’s 
release. But the demand for Battlefield was greater than ever, and the 
studio needed more people working on it. On top of that, Söderlund says 
he wanted to take the approach to a sequel slow. He wanted to wait for 
the right idea.</p> 
   <p>He wanted to handle it similarly to how the team created the first game.</p> 
   <p>Several years after <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>’s release, Söderlund 
once more put out a challenge to the developers at DICE. He allowed a 
handful of small groups of developers – teams of two or three – to come 
up with their own pitches for a potential <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> sequel.
 Once again, Söderlund and others at EA sat through multiple pitch 
meetings with ideas at various stages of development. And once again, 
nothing was quite clicking in the way Söderlund and the publisher 
wanted.</p>

   <cite>The way that audio director James Slavin describes it, sound in
 Mirror’s Edge Catalyst required a soft touch, and part of this involved
 embracing the game’s open-world design. Slavin spent a lot of time 
tweaking how Faith’s speed affects the audio. The faster she goes, the 
more that sound dulls around her. When Faith is at full-speed and 
pulling off combos, she is invincible to bullets; players can actually <em>hear</em> this, as bullets whiz past her head and the audio fades to a subdued roar.</cite>

  <div> 
   <p>Söderlund describes one of the more impressive pitches for a 
potential sequel that he sat in on. This one was far enough along to 
actually have a rendered, playable demo, the kind of thing that could 
easily have served as the announcement of the game. It was a nighttime 
scene, featuring Faith running through the city under the cover of dark,
 blazing along with all the speed and grace that fans of the original 
loved, taking out armed guards and never slowing down. It was cool, 
slick, action-packed; it was everything EA could have asked for in a 
follow-up.</p> 
   <p>For Söderlund, though, it was just too familiar.</p> 
   <p>"We were kind of going down the same path," Söderlund says. "It 
would have been a better game, and we would have done more, but would 
have been more of the same."</p> 
   <p>Söderlund didn’t want more of the same, because he felt like that 
approach to a sequel couldn’t address the problems DICE ran into with 
the first game. Moreover, just pumping out a minimal improvement over 
the original wasn’t true to the roots of that game, nor the developer’s 
creative ambitions, he says.</p> 
   <p>What DICE needed was a new perspective on Mirror’s Edge. What it needed was some new blood.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <h2>The big plan</h2> 
   <p>Sara Jansson started work at DICE as an associate producer around the same time that the first <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 was in development. Like Erik Odeldahl, her primary focus was on 
Battlefield. But also like Odeldahl, she watched the development of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> with interest, and she wanted a shot at the future of the series.</p> 
   <p>For her first step, Jansson recruited Odeldahl to serve as lead 
designer on her pitch. He remembers the day Jansson asked him to be 
involved. Within a moment of her asking, he let out an eager reply: "Of,
 of course. I have to do this. I’m going to do this."</p> 
   <p>They also brought in an art director to maintain the first game’s 
striking visual style, and a technical director to create a logical 
roadmap for building the game once they had ideas in place. Then they 
locked themselves in a room and got to work on a pitch.</p> 
   <div> 
    <div>
     <img alt="Sara Jansson" src="55_files/6dbd51c7-3487-4101-8d98-1762d16d250c.jpg" name="6dbd51c7-3487-4101-8d98-1762d16d250c" class="en-media">
    </div>
    <cite>Sara Jansson</cite> 
   </div> 
   <p>"What we looked at first of all was that we wanted to open up the 
game," Odeldahl says. "That’s where it started. We wanted to open up the
 world for exploration."</p> 
   <p>As Jansson and her team looked at the various failed pitches for <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 sequels, they realized that many of them shared one thing in common: 
They were, like the first game, linear and level-based in structure. 
Odeldahl had the breakthrough idea of turning the game that would become
 <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> into an open-world game. This move 
would set it apart from the first game while also creating an outlet to 
better explore the unique world.</p> 
   <p>"We wanted missions," says Odeldahl. "We wanted side missions. We 
wanted more characters to interact with. We wanted secrets hidden 
everywhere."</p> 
   <p>As with the first game, Söderlund’s first sign that <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> was <em>the one</em> was concern over whether or not DICE could pull it off, he says.</p> 
   <p>"My immediate reaction to the idea of making Mirror’s Edge 
open-world was, ‘Whoa, that sounds difficult, and it’s going to take a 
lot of time,’" he says, laughing. "At the same time, you can look at an 
open-world game like Grand Theft Auto, which is gigantic and where it 
truly is a sandbox, and you can more or less do whatever you want. Or 
you can describe an open-world game like one of the <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> games. Maybe those are a little more confined. It’s still seen as an open-world game, but not as expansive as GTA."</p> 
   <p>Söderlund, Jansson and Odeldahl found themselves in agreement that
 trying to turn Mirror’s Edge into something the scale of a Grand Theft 
Auto would not work. But as a more focused open-world game, one where 
everything in the world was built to enhance the game’s key mechanic of 
movement – that was exactly the unique hook Söderlund says he had been 
waiting for.</p> 
   <p>"They took a very different stance and approach to Mirror’s Edge,"
 Söderlund says of Jansson and Odeldahl. "They made it more modern in 
its design and more relevant, I would say. They also made some bold 
changes to the design."</p> 
   <p>It helped convince Söderlund, as well, that the small team also 
had a plan to facilitate its arduous goal of creating an open-world 
where the free running of Mirror’s Edge just works.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div>

    <img alt="Sonic art" src="55_files/1b016a8e-bfc2-4957-9e16-4ddf7e04321f.jpg" name="1b016a8e-bfc2-4957-9e16-4ddf7e04321f" class="en-media">
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <p>"When we started building the City of Glass [the setting of <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>],
 we blocked out all of the districts," Odeldahl explains. "Really early 
on, we had the city built out so you could traverse all of it. That 
shows us which areas were fine and just needed to be iterated on and 
improved. Other areas, we needed to change completely because it didn’t 
work. We basically started with the big building blocks and then just 
filled it in with more and more paths."</p> 
   <p>That’s not to say it was easy, of course. Odeldahl says there is not a single random element in the level design of <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>.
 "A level designer or level artist has placed each object exactly where 
it should be," he insists. This process has been time consuming, he 
says, but necessary to ensure that every part of the city functions 
perfectly with Faith’s moveset.</p> 
   <p>Another key to Jansson and Odeldahl’s vision for <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> was dropping guns entirely. Despite recognizing the gun combat as a weakness of the first <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, Söderlund was initially skeptical of the choice. Jansson, in particular, was adamant. The Faith in <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> didn’t need guns; she would be a stronger character, and it would be a better game, without them.</p> 
   <div>
    <q>It was part of the pitch: We’re going to do first-person melee. 
Everybody said, ‘That’s really hard.’ Yes, it is. But it was the right 
thing to do.</q>
   </div> 
   <p>"We decided to get rid of guns really early on," says Odeldahl. 
"It was part of the pitch: We’re going to do first-person melee. 
Everybody said, ‘That’s really hard.’ Yes, it is. But it was the right 
thing to do for this title, and we stuck to it and overcame the problems
 associated with it."</p> 
   <p><em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> narrative designer Christofer 
Emgard hadn’t joined the team at this early stage of the development, 
but the decision to cut guns was one he felt passionately about from a 
story perspective as well.</p> 
   <p>"I always felt that it was the cleaner choice from a narrative 
standpoint," he says. "It’s more fitting with her as a character and 
also the world in general. Having guns in the first game was maybe 
diluting that mojo. Removing it is more refined."</p> 
   <p>With a solid vision for <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> and, now, 
the support of Söderlund and EA, Jansson and Odeldahl began working on 
the game in earnest in 2012. They expanded the team, bringing fresh DICE
 recruit Amo Mostofi over from the Battlefield series as a lead producer
 and hiring Emgard to be the team’s in-house writer. James Slavin joined
 as an audio director. Together, that small team began the hard work of 
preparing to reveal the long-requested sequel to the world.</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <h2>Slow reveal</h2> 
   <p>On the afternoon of June 10, 2013, Erik Odeldahl stood backstage 
at the Shrine Auditorium with frayed nerves. On stage, EA had just 
finished showing off a bombastic 64-player multiplayer demo of <em>Battlefield 4</em>.
 This is normally where EA’s E3 press conference would end, but the 
company told those in attendance and watching online that it had a 
surprise to share.</p> 
   <p>The surprise was a minutelong trailer for the new Mirror’s Edge 
game that Odeldahl and team had been working on, which didn’t yet carry 
the Catalyst part of its title.</p> 
   <p>"I was panicking, because this was the first time we were going to
 show anything," Odeldahl says. "There was this gasp. There was this 
weird lull – lots of noise from the audience, and then suddenly it went 
quiet. And then ... it just erupted."</p> 
   <div> 
    <div>
     <img alt="Mirror’s Edge Catalyst" src="55_files/0e47e9d8-b08b-4d97-b31c-a06801ef2d66.jpg" name="0e47e9d8-b08b-4d97-b31c-a06801ef2d66" class="en-media">
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <p>Back home at DICE’s headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden, Christofer 
Emgard and the handful of other members of the small team working on the
 game watched the press conference from a projector in the studio’s 
kitchen. The reaction that Odeldahl felt there in person didn’t carry 
over via video, so immediately after the press conference finished, 
Emgard took to YouTube and began obsessively watching reaction videos.</p> 
   <p>"It felt very powerful to be part of this thing where people seemed to be reacting in such a positive way," he says.</p> 
   <p>While DICE didn’t show very much of what would become <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>
 in 2013, fans picked up on some important elements quickly. Most 
notably, EA was not positioning this as a sequel. Rather, the company 
said it was going to present a new origin story for protagonist Faith. 
Emgard was the key to the developer’s attempt to create a better story 
this time around.</p> 
   <p>"It was important for <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> to get a 
writer to be in-house all the time," says audio director James Slavin. 
Emgard was able to embed himself within the team in a way that’s rare 
for writers in this industry. He was able to work directly with the 
level designers, the audio team and everyone else to come up with the 
perfect pacing for storytelling.</p> 
   <p>For Emgard, it was a dream come true — a chance to build his own universe using a foundation he already care about.</p> 
   <p>"A lot of my initial work was just to create this world from a 
narrative standpoint," he says. "What are these corporations? What is 
the Conglomerate? How does it rule? Why do people accept it? One idea 
would give rise to another and back and forth."</p> 
   <p>For as much as <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> serves as an origin
 story for Faith, Emgard also approached it as a tale of the City of 
Glass itself. He says that through missions, incidental dialogue and 
more, players will form a picture of what this city is, who lives in 
each of its districts and how Faith’s presence there changes things.</p> 
   <p>Söderlund believes DICE has improved the plot in <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> by having Emgard with the team full-time.</p> 
   <div> 
    <div>

   </div> 
   <p>"The story in the first game could have been better," admits 
Söderlund. "This team has made a much better game from a story 
perspective this time around. When I played it, it’s a story I actually 
wanted to see more of and understand how it unfolds. I started to care 
about the characters in a different way than I did in the first game."</p> 
   <p>While DICE was excited to reveal the new Mirror’s Edge project to 
its fans in 2013, it was still at an extremely early point in 
development. By the time E3 2014 rolled around, the team still didn’t 
feel confident enough to show a lot more of the game. EA played a 
behind-the-scenes dev diary during EA’s press conference that year but 
didn’t show much new, much to the disappointment of eager fans.</p> 
   <p>By E3 2015, however, development had progressed significantly. The game had a new, final title — <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> — and DICE was ready to let people outside of the studio go hands-on with the game.</p> 
   <p>Lead producer Amo Mostofi attended E3 that year and got to watch 
players jumping into the game with an equal mix of excitement and fear.</p> 
   <p>"When it went out there, I think I kind of went numb a little 
bit," he says. "It was one of those moments of like, ‘Do I really want 
to be here? Do I really want to see this happen?’"</p> 
   <p>Mostofi’s fears were slowly but surely eased. He saw many fans make a beeline for the <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>
 demo as the first and most important thing they wanted to see on a 
packed E3 showfloor. Those fans had been waiting for this follow-up for 
many years, and by and large, they seemed to be happy with what they 
were playing.</p> 
   <p>"There are lots of expectations of how a Mirror’s Edge title 
should look and should sound and should play," says Odeldahl. "Almost 
everybody I talked to at E3 that year told me that we were doing the 
right thing. That felt great."</p> 
   <p>During E3 2015, EA announced that <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> 
would release on Feb. 23 of the next year. By the end of the year, that 
was pushed back to May 24, with a second delay moving the game back 
another few weeks to June 7.</p> 
   <p>While it was frustrating to fans who’ve been waiting so long for 
the game, Odeldahl says the delays have been extremely useful for the 
team.</p> 
   <div> 
    <div>
     <img alt="Mirror’s Edge Catalyst" src="55_files/f280c0be-3672-474f-8422-dbc5973b6711.jpg" name="f280c0be-3672-474f-8422-dbc5973b6711" class="en-media">
    </div> 
   </div> 
   <p>"We basically looked at some areas in the game and said, ‘We 
should improve these,’" he explains. "We got a few more months to do 
that, which was a great thing."</p> 
   <p>More recently, DICE and EA held a public beta for <em>Catalyst</em>
 — something that seems strange for a single-player focused game but was
 useful because of social elements like user-made challenges that the 
sequel will feature. Emgard notes his happiness with the reaction to 
this beta, saying there’s been "very little vitriol."</p> 
   <p>Odeldahl agrees: "As a game developer, after a while you become a 
bit jaded to online response. People can be a bit mean online sometimes.
 But we’ve been spared. People are really positive. The Mirror’s Edge 
community words their concerns carefully. They ask us things. There’s 
almost no negative vibe."</p> 
   <p>As time has crawled on and the game has neared completion, one by 
one, individual developers have left the project, moving onto the next 
big thing they’re working on at DICE. Just as the team slowly expanded 
from three or four main people to a larger group, it has shrunk back 
down as people finish whatever final things they need to work on. With 
the final release date now just a couple of weeks away, Emgard says he’s
 beginning to feel "post-project depression" alongside his excitement at
 finally getting <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> out the door.</p> 
   <p>"There’s always this huge expectation that when you’re done, it’s 
going to be such a huge relief," he says. "It’s out there. You can just 
enjoy seeing people playing it and enjoying it hopefully and all that. 
Of course there’s that too. But I’m definitely also feeling this sort of
 emptiness. Now this is done."</p> 
   <p>One very notable person in particular is missing from the team 
these days: senior producer Sara Jansson, who helped put together the 
team and get <em>Catalyst</em> off the ground. Earlier this month, just 
weeks before the game’s release, Jansson gave birth. She has since been 
home on maternity leave.</p> 
   <p>Even with a newborn taking up all her time, Jansson couldn’t help 
but take some time to express her excitement. "I couldn’t be prouder of 
the team," she says. "We have been working so hard on making sure we’re 
doing the game justice and getting everything right.</p> 
   <p>"In a way, you can say that I have two babies seeing the light of day just weeks apart."</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <h2>The future</h2> 
   <p>Even as the game is about to be released, there’s still an air of unexpectedness to <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>
 existing — to a massive publisher like EA "taking a chance" on a sequel
 to a game that wasn’t a breakout hit in the first place.</p> 
   <p>"I think it’s important that we allow a game like Mirror’s Edge to
 exist," says Söderlund. "When you’re the size of Electronic Arts, and 
when you have so many big games, I look at our games catalog as a 
portfolio. You have to look at it almost like a movie studio would look 
at it. You have your blockbusters. You have your more artistic, almost 
indie-like titles. There’s a market for those as well, and I think the 
industry deserves those types of products."</p> 
   <p>Söderlund believes <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> has the 
potential to do extremely well and to reach an even bigger audience than
 the first game. But he’s also realistic about it; he recognizes that it
 "probably won’t be a GTA in terms of audience size."</p> 
   <p>Players wanted it, though, as did the studio. And perhaps just as importantly, <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> contains technology and design lessons that Söderlund believes will be useful to DICE and EA as a whole moving forward.</p> 
   <div>
    <q>The very fact that we greenlit <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> and that we’re moving ahead with it speaks volumes about our mindset.</q>
   </div> 
   <p>"There’s a lot of learnings that, should we not build another 
Mirror’s Edge for various reasons — a lot of the things that we’ve done 
will serve as great learnings for whatever else we build," he says. "As 
you know, EA is pushing quite hard as a company to move into the action 
space. A lot of stuff like going to an open-world structure, going to a 
nonlinear narrative, building out characters and stories — these are 
things that we need to learn and perfect as a company. Sometimes, you 
have to look at it long-term.</p> 
   <p>"I hope that <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> does extremely well. 
But in a world where it may or may not do well, it’s important for us to
 understand that everything that we do needs to be seen in the longer 
perspective. You can’t just look at it in isolation."</p> 
   <p>The developers at DICE echo this point from a slightly different 
angle. Mostofi says that Mirror’s Edge’s existence is evidence of the 
passion that’s alive at the developer, proof that the team is about more
 than just "this first-person shooter, Battlefield juggernaut." He says 
that even as the company has grown into a triple-A studio competing with
 some of the most popular franchises in the world, it has maintained the
 sense of being an underdog internally.</p> 
   <p>"The very fact that we greenlit <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> 
and that we’re moving ahead with it speaks volumes about our mindset," 
Mostofi says. "No one is sitting there going, ‘We make one of the 
biggest games in the world; we know what we’re doing.’ We’ve still got 
to push forward and look for something different and new and fresh."</p> 
   <p>Odeldahl concurs: "We don’t want to constantly be working on the 
same things. We don’t want to just iterate. Sometimes you want to do 
something that’s completely out of left field, that scares people on the
 development team."</p> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <div>
    <img alt="ME2" src="55_files/0b7bbb78-0c9f-401b-b3ba-240e02c06b9d.jpg" name="0b7bbb78-0c9f-401b-b3ba-240e02c06b9d" class="en-media">
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <p>It’s become commonplace to view massive game development houses as
 factories built to pump out the latest mainstream sensation. For DICE, 
both the first Mirror’s Edge game and its long-awaited follow-up serve 
as evidence that the studio isn't a conveyer belt for military shooters.</p> 
   <p>And yet, where the franchise goes from here will in all likelihood be determined by sales.</p> 
   <p>"Whether or not there’s another Mirror’s Edge is going to be up to
 the people out there," Söderlund says. "If we can convince them that 
there’s a market for this, that people want to buy it, and if they tell 
us they want another one, then we’ll make another one. If the answer is 
that there wasn’t a big enough audience, it’s too difficult and too much
 work goes into making a game to build a game that we know people 
probably don’t want."</p> 
   <p>For its part, the team that worked on <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>
 directly seems ready and eager to see the franchise grow from here. 
Emgard says he "got lost a little bit" in the creation of the game’s 
world, building dozens of potential narrative hooks to expand out from 
here. Mostofi is confident that the series "will have an exciting 
future."</p> 
   <p>Odeldahl is the only member of the team to exercise a little more 
caution. "We should definitely do another Mirror’s Edge," he says, 
before stressing, "when it’s the right thing."</p> 
   <p>He doesn’t want to forget what both games in the series have been 
built on so far: pushing not for more of the same, not for iteration, 
but for something new and surprising and different. If and when there’s a
 third Mirror’s Edge game, we can only hope that it continues that 
tradition. <img alt="Babykayak" src="55_files/10a487f3-0e32-4db2-84e7-cdaf7b34b469.png" name="10a487f3-0e32-4db2-84e7-cdaf7b34b469" class="en-media"></p>
