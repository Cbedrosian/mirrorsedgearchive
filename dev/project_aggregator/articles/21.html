    <p></p><div><img alt="minto" src="21_files/b4768bdb-4819-42d1-ae5d-9e63c73d2462.jpg" name="b4768bdb-4819-42d1-ae5d-9e63c73d2462" class="en-media" width="576" height="521"></div>Despite having spoken to <strong>EA DICE’s Andreas Almström</strong> not too long ago, I found that there was more to learn about the inside of DICE’s audio team. So I reached out to <strong>Ben Minto</strong>,
 the company’s Sound Director, asking for an interview, and he obliged. 
You can read our chat below, where talk about his work in the industry, <strong>Mirror’s Edge, Star Wars,</strong> and more.<p></p>
<p><strong>Talk about your beginnings in audio and how you ended up at DICE.</strong></p>
<p>Whilst working as a ProTools installation engineer in London, one of my clients and soon-to-be future boss, <strong>Stephen Root</strong>, persuaded me to join him, working as a Sound Designer out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclaim_Entertainment" title="Acclaim Entertainment’s " target="_blank"><strong>Acclaim Entertainment’s</strong> </a>studio
 in Croydon. Over time, Acclaim UK gradually shrunk in size until I was 
one of only four people left working out of their London offices, 
finishing up the audio on some of their 3rd party projects. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion_Games" title="Criterion Games" target="_blank"><strong>Criterion Games</strong></a>, a developer who had previously worked with Acclaim to develop and publish <strong>TrickStyle</strong>,
 wanted to improve the audio quality of their projects, and so they 
offered to hire the small remaining audio team from Acclaim as a 
ready-made solution – we all accepted! Whilst working at Criterion 
Games, I helped develop many games including two of my favourite 
classics “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_3:_Takedown" title="Burnout 3" target="_blank"><strong>Burnout 3</strong></a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_(video_game)#Reception" title="Black" target="_blank"><strong>Black</strong></a>”, both of which were published by EA, who eventually went on to buy Criterion back in 2004.</p>
<p>Having made racing games at Criterion for 7 years (and for a few 
years before that whilst at Acclaim), you can eventually become fatigued
 making similar titles over and over. It was a perfect time for me to 
shift from the Burnout (racing games) to the Black (FPS) team. Whilst we
 were working on the pre-production for “Black 2′′, it was decided to 
give the game a bit more time to see where the next generation of 
consoles would take us. In the meantime, I was asked what I wanted to do
 whilst we waited, and it was suggested that I could take a short 
secondment within EA. So, I contacted some of the other audio people I 
knew across EA, and one of the offers that came back was from <strong>Magnus Walterstad</strong> at <strong>DICE</strong>, saying that he was working on a project called <strong>Mirror’s Edge</strong>
 (released 2008) and that he needed someone to help him with the guns 
and Foley. I agreed, thinking I’d work here for about six months and 
then return ʻhomeʼ to finish “<strong>Black 2″</strong>. Nine years later, I’m still here, ha-ha.</p>
<p></p><div><div></div></div><p></p>
<p><strong>So you work as the Sound Director, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Although I might add that each project can have a different Sound Director. For “Mirrors Edge” it was <strong>James Slavin</strong>. On the current “<strong>Battlefield 1</strong>” it’s <strong>Ben Pajor</strong>. On “<strong>Star Wars Battlefront</strong>”
 it’s me. In addition to my Director role, I also look after the entire 
audio department in general also, along with the Audio Line Manager, <strong>Björn Hedberg</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve heard that you received a degree in Computational Fluid 
Dynamics, which sounds advanced to say the least. Has this field of 
study been applicable to what you do today?</strong></p>
<p>Very much so, since it has a lot to do with problem solving and 
crafting elegant, yet optimal solutions. I’ve always enjoyed the 
certainty of mathematics, which contrasts very much to the open-ended 
nature of creative sound design. You know that 1 + 1 is always going to 
be 2, but you can have many different ideas and opinions on how, for 
example, the sound of an exploding mutant chicken should sound.</p>
<p>What I like about my current role is that it offers me the chance to 
work in both the technical and creative worlds. Also, the way we work at
 DICE is very much the cradle-to- grave approach. To explain this, if 
someone is working on vehicles´, they’ll start by looking at the 
vehicles specifications from the game design and what sounds are needed 
to support that, and then they need to come up with an overall sound 
design plan for the work, go out to record and collect source material, 
create the sound assets needed, implement these assets within the engine
 via the editor, mix the vehicle components also within the engine and 
then balance the completed vehicle sound model against the already 
existing sounds in the title. So even in that simple example there’s 
quite a huge breadth of creative and technical aspects to the work that 
we do.</p>
<p>I’ve found at DICE that all sound designers here are more technically
 proficient than the industry average. This is essential when using a 
start-to-finish approach, versus splitting work up along its path, and 
giving each part to different specialist individuals and it also helps 
us keep a high level of consistency, ownership and quality across each 
work area.</p>
<p><strong>Since your sound designers have all have their own 
proficiency and ways of working, what happens when there’s a 
conflict?&nbsp; between you and a member of your team? How do you 
diffuse that?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Making mistakes is important (making them quickly and cheaply is even
 better!), and it’s hard to learn from other people’s mistakes; we all 
find it easier to learn from our own mistakes. Learning to diffuse and 
avoid conflict takes time. If I need someone to design an ambience for 
the first time, I need to be patient enough, and give them time, to 
allow them to learn how to do it their way. I can offer mentoring and 
guidance, but I must be careful not to enforce my own understanding and 
process on them and insist that they work how I do. It’s easy to fall 
into the “old man” syndrome after you’ve been in the industry a while, 
where you strongly resist deviating from a set way of working. I try to 
avoid that because I know that in the games industry we must discard the
 technology we use every 5 years or so as new platforms come out. So 
being open to change and new ways of thinking is key to remaining at the
 edge of game development. The processes we developed for the original 
Xbox are still slightly relevant, they are not as important as the 
innovations we need to develop for the Xbox One.</p>
<p><strong>Since you touched on how technology easily becoming 
irrelevant, I want to ask what about game hardware. Console specs seems 
to have advanced to the point problems like RAM limitation isn’t the 
issue it used to be in the early 2000s. What are the new challenges for 
you guys now that the new generation of consoles has an increased 
capacity in it’s resources?</strong></p>
<p>Recently, when I was reviewing the work of another sound designer, I 
pulled up some of their raw samples and noticed that they had left about
 half a second’s worth of silence at the end of some of the samples, 
beyond the point at which the sample had zero amplitude. That doesn’t 
matter too much these days, since that amount of sample data doesn’t 
take up much space, and the compression formats we use deal with silence
 very effectively. It’s just that my old ways of thinking from back when
 RAM was an issue drew my attention to it. It also reminded me that 
certain things don’t matter so much today as they used to. In theory, 
the sound for a game could utilize around about 500MB of RAM on the PS4 
if that was needed. That’s like loading up a whole album of uncompressed
 music to play at the same time, but as a combination of music, sound 
effects and VO! So, as you said, our challenges have changed. RAM is a 
manageable resource these days, but it’s a lot less of the constraint 
that it was 10 years ago. Today CPU and optimization is where we must be
 vigilant.</p>
<p>When you look at a screenshot of a Frostbite engine patch, you’ll see
 that part of our CPU cost is due to running multiple instances of a 
massive amount of connections, logic, samplers, DSP and mixing within 
each patch. However, our sound design demands can be roughly 2-3 times 
more complex than what those patches show, so we must optimize, be 
clever and get the desired results in other ways. It’s nice to build 
behaviorally complex, reactive and good-sounding systems for our sounds,
 but if it’s going to take 2 months to implement, be expensive at 
run-time, and have many similar versions running at the same time within
 one level, then it’s safe to say it’s overkill. So, spending too much 
of your CPU budget on overly complex systems for every sound isn’t the 
way to go. Some sounds can be treated simply, whilst others will require
 that extra level of implementation to deliver the sound experience we 
want. These barriers always seem to&nbsp; be short term issues and in a 
few more generations, like RAM before it, this won’t be so much of an 
issue.</p>
<p>Today we also have many human and large data challenges. If you’re 
making a car game with 1000 cars, how are you going to maintain the 
audio for that, in terms of consistency, quality and feel? If you make 
one car a day, then by the 1000th day, your idea of what a good car 
sounds like will be totally different from when you started, so you’d 
have to retackle your initial cars to bring them up to the new level of 
quality and direction that you applied to your 1000th car model. To 
handle this at DICE , we have implemented hierarchical systems, based on
 parent and child patches. For example, in a first-person shooter game, 
we could start with a parent “Weapon”, and that might split into an 
“Automatic” and “Non-Automatic”, and “Automatic” might lead into an 
“SMG”, an “Assault Rifle” and so on. If at a later stage we want to add a
 “Silencer” or maybe a filter to all our weapons, we could add it at the
 parent stage, so that it then propagates down through the generations 
to all the children patches. Previously, without this workflow, this 
could mean that we would have to individually add the functionality to 
each child patch or create a whole new series of unique patches, which 
is of course time consuming and error prone. When designing new core 
systems, we now utilize the power of inherited configurations and shared
 content. As an example, whilst the initial “bang” of a pistol could 
sound unique and be made from a unique sample set, the tail and 
reflection could be shared and be commonly used amongst a group of 
similar pistols. This reduces the initial amount of work needed to be 
done and the time needed to maintain such systems, whilst maintaining a 
consistent feel and sound to the patches within that family, and when 
it’s time to add additional content via updates or DLC, you just need to
 add the new unique elements and logic for a specific item, since the 
default core elements already exist and can be reused.</p>
<p><strong>When games come out, you see a lot of reviews about the title
 in general, but not much is said about the audio in particular. How do 
you feel about the fact that the average consumer hasn’t develop the 
capacity to appreciate effort dedicated to game audio? I mean, a 
nice-sounding fire from a game in 2008 would be hard for the average 
gamer to distinguish from one made in 2016, right? So are audio teams 
sometimes striving to achieve audio quality for it’s own sake, rather 
than for a functional purpose in the game? </strong></p>
<p>There are two things I’d address in that question. Your description 
of the “average consumer” may very well be correct, but we both know 
that you only have to read a few Reddit posts after you have released a 
title to see that certain people dig through the game to find out what’s
 behind your creation, at which point they could have a similar 
understanding to you about the games’ technical aspects. We’ve seen 
online conversations that go deeper than the ones we have amongst our 
own staff. Sometimes we hear sounds in the game that we don’t even know 
we made, since the audio experience is a complex interaction of random 
elements combined at run-time. So the scale of player awareness, from 
someone who doesn’t even play with the sound on to someone who dissects 
the title over may hours of gameplay and makes in-depth reviews of their
 findings, is huge.</p>
<p>Secondly, about whether we do things for our own sake, I look at 
three different groups of listeners: the public, the press and our 
peers. These different groups are always present in your mind as you 
work, and you know that each one will have a different perception of the
 work that you’re creating. Let’s talk about your comment on a fire 
sound in 2008: that fire would have probably been mono, static and short
 looping in nature; you’d have heard the same thing again and again. Had
 there been 3 fires near each other, there could have been phasing 
between the audio. Also, the burning of the wet wood would have sounded 
exact the same as the dry wood. If the wind was blowing, the fire 
wouldn’t have reacted at all to that. Most people might not care about 
that sort of thing in terms of sound, but it’s bigger than just sound; 
you could encode information into the fire. For example,&nbsp;a change 
in the wind or weather might be indicated by what was burning, how long 
has it been burning, and if the fire suddenly flares up in a certain 
way.</p>
<p>People appreciate the small details that sound designers and artists 
put into their work. It is possible that our staff could obsess over 
details, but that’s where my job of keeping everyone on course comes in.</p>
<p><strong>When games achieve appreciable success, the press mainly talk
 about the commercial aspect, such as sales. In what way do you think 
the audio experience contributes to that success? I’ve seen cases were 
certain soundtracks receive praise from reviews, as happened for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shovel_Knight" title="Shovel Knight" target="_blank">Shovel Knight</a>“,
 but I rarely read about people appreciating the foley or VO. If a game 
sells well, how much credit do you think goes to the audio?</strong></p>
<p>Sound is hard to gauge, because it rarely exists in isolation. No-one
 closes their eyes while playing and just listens to the audio (unless 
they’re hardcore audiophiles). People today are a lot less concerned 
about breaking down the audio on its own as much as enjoying the whole 
game experience. If the sound is crap, people will notice. However, if 
the sound is what it needs to be, people won’t comment on it, since it’s
 playing its role of being a part of the larger game experience. I mean,
 the average consumer of movies has no clue that most of the audio in a 
film is replaced in post. Nature programs made me realize this when I 
was younger; I’d always wonder how the camera-man recorded the lion 
eating when he’s 3 miles away. The sound was probably created by a 
´foley person playing with their lunch!</p>
<p><strong>What game titles do you personally think are exemplary for their audio and soundtracks?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption" title="Red Dead Redemption " target="_blank"><strong>Red Dead Redemption </strong></a>was
 great, and springs to mind as the sequel has just been announced! The 
original came out around the same time as we shipped BFBC2 and I put 
quite a few hours into it and thoroughly enjoyed and ‘got’ the audio and
 soundtrack, as well as spending way too many hours completing the 
Hunter Challenges. Games like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)" title="Journey" target="_blank"><strong>Journey</strong></a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbo_(video_game)" title="Limbo" target="_blank"><strong>Limbo</strong></a>”
 also have beautifully constructed soundscapes that matches and supports
 the gameplay, artwork and tone. Then of course, other titles like “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us" title="The Last Of Us" target="_blank"><strong>The Last Of Us</strong></a>”, “Bioshock” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted" title="Uncharted" target="_blank"><strong>Uncharted</strong></a>”
 are well regarded champions of game audio and rightly so. It’s hard to 
mention a game that people don’t know about, since the best games tend 
to garner a lot of attention and win awards. People do respond to good 
audio.</p>
<p>Personally, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_4_Dead" title="Left For Dead" target="_blank"><strong>Left For Dead</strong></a>”
 is one of my favourites because of the audio language it used. Anytime a
 tank would appear, the game used one of three ways to communicate that 
to you: a character would shout, “Oh my god, tank!”, or you’d hear the 
guttural bellow of a tank, or you’d get a music cue warning of the 
tank’s approach. The beauty of it all was that the game was chaotic with
 its zombies and violence, but the cues that you needed to navigate that
 chaos were so simple and didn’t feel forced. Even though other aspects 
of the audio weren’t the best in world, like the samples used or the 
mix, I appreciated that the audio filled its role and created a very 
readable language that gave the players the relevant information about 
what was happening around them, so they could react and play the game 
better. I use it as a reference a lot for my work today – is the 
information that we are encoding into our sounds readable by our 
players?</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel like certain genres of games tend to be more consistent in delivering compelling audio experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, sort of. Everyone likes a good story, and when the audio is 
supporting and driving the narrative, the playing experience tends to be
 more compelling. In “<strong>Overwatch</strong>“, where the developers 
talk about how players can play the game just by listening to what’s 
happening around them, it’s like what I was saying about “Left for 
Dead”. The audio is not only good, but also functional in that it 
contains the correct decodable information that allows a player to tell 
what is happening, or going to happen, around them, thereby giving them 
the ability to react accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re the boss of a team of sound designers for a major
 title like “Star Wars: Battlefront”, what kind of responsibility rests 
on your shoulders? What’s at stake in terms of your success or failure 
at mobilizing your team to do their jobs well</strong></p>
<p>Well, in my experience with other UK and US development teams, your 
head can very much be on the block and the Audio Director is held 
responsible for whatever comes out of the speaker. If that’s the kind of
 hierarchical setup a company wants, where the Audio Director is the 
boss with minions working under him, then I think that person’s job 
should very well be on the line if anything goes drastically wrong. 
Thankfully, DICE isn’t like that. We’re a team that works together, and 
as much as I’m ready to take the responsibility for potential mistakes 
that are made in the department, I focus away from ordering people 
around and more on enabling them, and thankfully, we’ve never shipped a 
bad sounding game.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for 18+ years alongside many other talented 
people who are veterans in the industry, so we’ve been able to tackle 
most things quite well. Take “<strong>Star Wars:Battlefront</strong>” 
for instance. This was a brand-new IP for us at DICE, and one of the 
most beloved IPʼs in the world, to the extent that people can tell when 
individual recordings aren’t the real ones from the films. So, as the 
DICE Audio team, we knew that we had to get it right. Despite the 
pressure we all felt at delivering a great sounding game, I still felt 
confident going on paternity leave 4 months before “Battlefront” 
shipped. That was possible because the team could keep working despite 
my absence, since our setup and lack of hierarchy allows everything to 
keep running even when the “boss” isn’t around.</p>

<p><strong>As someone who plays a part in hiring new talent to your 
team, do you think the learning curve for aspiring sound designers today
 bigger than what you needed in 90s? Because of the constant 
technological advances since then, wouldn’t a new sound designer need a 
bigger reservoir of knowledge concerning computers and audio recording 
than in the past?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Well, some of the stuff I was doing 15 years ago is irrelevant today,
 such as how to make looped material that obeyed proprietary compression
 formats. But that knowledge was what was needed then and now you need 
to learn different more relevant skills. To be honest, if you’re already
 doing sound design today, then you are already probably very tech 
savvy. Most game audio academic courses have a fair degree of technical 
studies in there. So, it’s not unreasonable to expect applicants to know
 the basics. We’re not going to ask someone how well they know 
Frostbite. It wouldn’t make any sense, since it’s a proprietary system 
that we don’t share with anyone outside of EA, but it’s not always about
 hard skills. If someone comes for an interview at DICE and has a ton of
 knowledge, but is competing against another person with half the 
knowledge that comes across as a better team fit, I’d go with the latter
 person. You can teach people technical things as long as they’re open 
to learning, whereas fitting with an existing team is not something you 
can necessarily learn or even teach.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve mentioned in past interviews that library sounds are a
 part of your sound palette. I’ve heard other sound folk say that they 
stay away from library sounds, so as to not create a sound signature 
that’s generic. How do you avoid this if you’re open to using library 
stuff?</strong></p>
<p>Well, just to clarify, it’s not like I’d use an off-the-shelf general
 sound effects library, pull out stock sound effect #73 and stick it in a
 game. It’s not like that. I make use of samples and source material to 
create other sounds, whether it’s something from a library or one of my 
own recordings. It’s very rare in my line of work that you find a sound 
that’s exactly right for the task at hand. It’s either going to need 
something added to it or taken away, or edited. A library sound can be a
 great ingredient or part of the final sound. Most of the audio team 
here know which sounds are overused, and it’s important that you don’t 
use those sounds in a way that triggers people’s memories of that sound 
from another game; that would break the experience.</p>
<p>I think the heaviest critique against sound libraries was around 15 years ago when we only had around 10 of them, like <a href="https://www.hollywoodedge.com/" title="Hollywood Edge&amp;nbsp;" target="_blank"><strong>Hollywood Edge&nbsp;</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.sound-ideas.com/" title=" Sound Ideas" target="_blank"><strong> Sound Ideas</strong></a>,
 whereas today we have more material to work with. So, it’s not as taboo
 as it used to be. I think today’s stigma might be more related to when 
aspiring sound designers show their demo reels and they have used sound 
effects straight off common libraries. You wouldn’t like to hear that 
reviewing someone’s show-reel, as you get pulled out of the experience 
that you are trying to review.</p>
<p><strong>The traditional recording industry is still having the 
“analog” vs “digital” debate when it comes to gear. Sound designers 
don’t seem to have any aversion to going digital at all, in spite of the
 sonic changes that brings when compared to analog. Out of curiosity, 
I’d like to ask if you think a AAA game can be made using only analog 
gear?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Analog is great, but at some point, you might need to transfer a 
session to someone else that you’re working with. For example, someone 
might want to adjust the reverb track volume, which would normally be an
 audio bounce on a separate track. If you have had to burn the reverb 
into the original audio file because you’re using an analogue plate 
reverb, you can’t always ship that plate to your colleague when they 
need to work on the session. If you have to process 10,000 lines of 
dialogue with reverb, you don’t want to do it in real-time. And when 
it’s time to localize all your audio, you don’t want to have to be 
buying multiple plate reverbs to send to each location around the world.
 So, while it’s more tactile and usually more satisfying to play with 
analogue gear, for me it’s better suited for the source side of things. 
If I’m mass processing my audio, I don’t want to have to run it to tape 
four times and then run it back into my workstation, for that I’d rather
 use a chain of plugins.</p>
<p><strong>So you think analog and digital sound the same?</strong></p>
<p>No. Definitely not. But it all comes down to what works best for the 
task at hand. It’s like Max said in his interview, do you add distortion
 at the recording stage or afterwards? If it sounds good, it is good. 
Analog is expensive, it’s hard to maintain, and you must be constantly 
running things back and forth. If you turn it off, and you’re dealing 
with older gear, it won’t sound the same when you turn it on again, 
since the temperature changes and components wear down. If you buy the 
exact same analogue unit as I have from the 70s, the difference in the 
tolerances of the components means that yours could sound different than
 mine, even if they’re the same brand and model. Sometimes it’s more 
important to be consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Wrapping up, I’d like to touch on a subject you spoke on yet 
another past interview, which was how you had your recorder with you on a
 trip to Dubai, and took the time to record wind sounds whilst there. 
You made use of the unique geography of the place to record the sound of
 the wind blowing against grass and rocks. How have you built up the 
knowledge for understanding how field recordings are affected by 
geography?</strong></p>
<p>By listening and making mistakes. If you can make mistakes cheaply 
and quickly in your free time, do it. If you want to make wind 
recordings, go and do that in your own city on your own. You might find 
that it’s hard to do because of the traffic and city noise, so perhaps 
you’ll aim for coming out in the morning, but then you’ll discover that 
the birds singing is a problem, and so you’ll have to be increasingly 
creative with your approach. Also, wind makes no sound on its own, but 
rather when it interacts with other surfaces. So, if you know that, 
you’ll start looking for surfaces that interact with the wind, like 
grass for example. Then you might think, “<em>My hearing is better than 
the signal to noise ratio on my handheld recorder, so I’d be better off 
finding a bigger patch of grass that blows more in the wind. And it’ll 
help the movement if I brush the grass with my hand as the wind blows.</em>” This kind of thinking is how you learn your way forward on your own, but it’s always more fun to learn from and with others.</p>
<p><strong>So what’s next for you now that “Battlefront” is out and doing so well?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Mostly more Star Wars! I’m helping a bit with the DLC for “Battlefront”, and have spent a few months on “<em>Battlefield 1</em>“, but now it’s onwards with the next “Star Wars” title.</p>
