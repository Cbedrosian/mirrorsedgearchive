   <h1>Interview: Rhianna Pratchett</h1>
   <div>
    <div></div>
   </div>
  </div> Answering our questions all the way from sunny Mexico 
(not&nbsp;pictured), we speak to the prolific writer behind Mirror’s 
Edge,Tomb Raider and Heavenly Sword. 
  <h4>(Words: Michael O’Connell-Davidson, Research: Michael O’Connell-Davidson &amp; Rhian Carruthers)</h4> 
  <p><b>“You do know I’m on Holiday, right? ;)” </b>Rhianna 
Pratchett&nbsp;has sent us her responses while holidaying Mexico, after 
e-mailing&nbsp;them to her far later than we’d initially intended. The 
excited feeling&nbsp;I get knowing that she’s responded to us in time to
 hit the printers is&nbsp;quickly replaced by the growing feeling that 
we’ve done a very bad&nbsp;thing emailing her so late.</p> 
  <p>Pratchett began her career writing for the “late, great” PC Zone. 
“I&nbsp;spent a few years at the coalface of British games journalism 
before&nbsp;leaving to go freelance. I was offered a gig as a 
story-editor for&nbsp;a hard-core RPG called Beyond Divinity, and it all
 kicked off from&nbsp;there.” Chances are, if you’re reading this, 
you’ve played something&nbsp;Rhianna was involved in; she was the writer
 for, among other projects,&nbsp;Heavenly Sword, the Tomb Raider reboot 
and Mirror’s Edge.</p> 
  <p>It’s a very different medium to write for, both in terms of 
the&nbsp;practicalities and the way the audience interacts with the 
text. “The&nbsp;role that the player undertakes in a game, and the 
relationship they&nbsp;have with the narrative, is very different from 
that of a regular viewer&nbsp;or reader. They absorb the narrative in an
 active, rather than passive&nbsp;way. They don’t just watch or read the
 story, they are the story. It is an&nbsp;experience, an adventure, a 
journey.”</p> 
  <p>Yet despite the complicated player-narrative relationship, 
“the&nbsp;industry is still getting used to the idea of using 
professional writers,&nbsp;let alone using them correctly.” She 
describes writers in the games&nbsp;industry as being in the 
“square-peg-in-round-hole” phase.</p> 
  <p>Despite the dystopian narrative being one of most 
memorable&nbsp;aspects of the original Mirror’s Edge, Pratchett entered 
into the&nbsp;development process towards the end of production. “Unless
 they are&nbsp;already part of the development team, a writer will often
 be brought&nbsp;in a year or more into the development process and they
 will have to&nbsp;create a story around existing assets. It’s a bit 
like writing a movie at&nbsp;the same time that it’s being filmed.”</p>

  <p>“You are a cog in a machine, trying to turn well with the other 
cogs,&nbsp;all of which have their own needs and agendas. You can still 
do great&nbsp;things, but you have to be very lucky with your team and 
working&nbsp;environment.”</p> 
  <p>Despite that, though, things are only getting better. 
Director-writers&nbsp;like Ken Levine and Tim Schafer are becoming more 
common, and&nbsp;there are many more games writers in business than 
there were even&nbsp;five years ago. “The press and players are taking 
narrative more&nbsp;seriously and there’s much more discussion and 
advice out there&nbsp;about it. We’re still fighting a hard battle, but 
we have a few more&nbsp;soldiers in the trenches.”</p> 
  <p>Even so, this increased prominence of narrative in video games 
has&nbsp;not come without controversy. We speak about Zoe Quinn’s 
seminal&nbsp;Depression Quest, which provides a unique insight into the 
mind of a&nbsp;someone suffering from the titular condition. “The abuse 
Zoe received&nbsp;over Depression Quest was utterly disgusting.”</p> 
  <p>Much of the criticism leveraged against her came from the fact 
that&nbsp;the game was text-based, but, as Pratchett notes, “Text-based 
games&nbsp;have a long and proud history in the industry.”</p> 
  <p>“Really that’s where the genesis of so many games stemmed 
from.&nbsp;The notion of ‘what is a game?’ absolutely needs to be 
challenged.&nbsp;Games that explore deeply personal subjects and shed 
light on&nbsp;experiences that many people are unaware of are something 
weneed more of. Games can just be for sheer entertainment, but as 
a&nbsp;community and an industry it’s vital that we make room for games 
with&nbsp;something to say.”</p> 
  <p>The games industry – and its associated community – has 
received&nbsp;a lot of negative media attention in recent years. Blurred
 Lines: The&nbsp;Battle of the Sexes, a recent BBC2 documentary, painted
 a picture&nbsp;of the gaming community (and, indeed, the internet at 
large) as a&nbsp;virulent place for women, and the #1reasonwhy was 
described as&nbsp;the hashtag that “exposed games industry sexism” by 
The Guardian.</p> 
  <p>But Pratchett – who has been a gamer since she was a 
young&nbsp;child – thinks it’s more complex than that. “[It’s] not fair 
in the least.&nbsp;Characterizing any industry in just one light is 
unlikely to be accurate&nbsp;or show the full picture.”</p> 
  <p>“The wider media tends to be wildly behind the times, and has 
a&nbsp;history of depicting games in a negative light. This is partly 
due to&nbsp;the fact that society likes to have its scapegoats (the 
waltz, rock’n’roll,&nbsp;video nasties etc.) and partly due to the fact 
that so many people&nbsp;(parents in particular) are ill-informed about 
the content of games, or&nbsp;the sheer variety available.”</p> 
  <p>Indeed, Pratchett started a counterpart hashtag to 
#1reasonwhy,&nbsp;#1reasontobe. “I wanted to show that although it’s 
important to shine&nbsp;light into the dark corners of this world and 
show the battles being&nbsp;fought, it’s also important to show what’s 
worth fighting for.”</p> 
  <p>She admits that her experience has been largely positive. “I 
haven’t&nbsp;felt particularly maligned or abused because of my gender. 
There’s&nbsp;always the trolls, but they are pretty much a given if 
you’re in the public&nbsp;eye and online [but] there’s no denying that 
some women have had&nbsp;very negative experiences and that is awful. 
Hopefully more people&nbsp;are becoming aware of the problems and doing 
more to alleviate&nbsp;them. It might seem like the trolls are winning 
sometimes, but I have&nbsp;found that there’s also a great deal of 
support out there.”</p> 
  <p>Gender representation in video games is very complex, and 
has&nbsp;been the subject of much critical debate by academics and 
games&nbsp;writers. Pratchett, who worked closely with developers on the
 Tomb&nbsp;Raider reboot, was involved in shaping the representation of 
arguably&nbsp;the most iconic woman in video games.</p>

  <p>What was that like? “It really was a once in a life time 
opportunity.&nbsp;I mean it’s Lara Croft, right? Even my mum knows who 
she is. It was a&nbsp;real honour to get to work on a character as 
iconic as Lara and a team&nbsp;as hugely talented as Crystal Dynamics. 
It also felt that it was the right&nbsp;time in my career to take on 
such a challenge. It’s really wonderful to&nbsp;see how warmly she’s 
been received. I’m delighted to have been a&nbsp;part of that.” 
Pratchett is still involved with the Tomb Raider project,&nbsp;and is 
currently working on companion comics with Dark Horse.</p> 
  <p>But have representations of women in games changed for the 
better?&nbsp;“It’s hard to tell because so few AAA games have female 
protagonists.&nbsp;There were only three in 2013 (Tomb Raider, Beyond: 
Two Souls and&nbsp;Remember Me). However, I think we have seen some 
really interesting&nbsp;female secondary characters emerging in recent 
years such as Ellie&nbsp;in The Last of Us and Elizabeth in Bioshock 
Infinite. You do get more&nbsp;female led titles in smaller, indie 
games, which unfortunately don’t&nbsp;always get the recognition they 
deserve, although I was pleased to&nbsp;see Gone Home get so many 
plaudits.</p> 
  <p>“I think the marketing of female characters is going through a 
shift&nbsp;at the moment. The previous Tomb Raiders were often marketed 
in a&nbsp;very sexualised, just-for-the-guys way. Not only did it not 
really reflect&nbsp;the games themselves, but I think that was rather 
off putting for some&nbsp;female gamers, myself included, and probably 
some male ones too.&nbsp;Now that way of portraying a female character 
seems positively&nbsp;archaic. Lara is for everyone.”</p> 
  <p>Another strong female representation Pratchett authored 
was&nbsp;Mirror’s Edge protagonist, Faith, who was designed to resemble 
real&nbsp;women more closely – a deviation from the women of Soul 
Calibur,&nbsp;Dead or Alive, and even the original Tomb Raider.</p>

  <p>With a sequel set before the events of the original game in 
the&nbsp;works, I asked Pratchett how she felt about the project; 
despite writing&nbsp;the original (as well as working with DC on a 
series of comics), EA&nbsp;have begun development without her.</p> 
  <p>Does this feel like an undoing of her legacy? “I wrote the 
prequel&nbsp;story in the comics, so I guess they’re completely 
rewriting that for the&nbsp;next game. They own the IP, so it’s 
absolutely their right to do so.”</p> 
  <p>She notes her first clue was that nobody contacted her by the time 
of&nbsp;the announcement. “No one I worked with on Mirror’s Edge is 
even&nbsp;at the studio anymore, let alone working on the next game. I 
know as&nbsp;much about it as the average gamer. The first project was 
very hard&nbsp;for all concerned. However, it would’ve been nice for 
them to have&nbsp;checked in with me to see if I was even interested in 
working on the&nbsp;next one, as I’d spent more time expanding the 
world, stories and&nbsp;characters than anyone else on the team. I think
 there would have to&nbsp;be a very different attitude towards the 
narrative this time around for&nbsp;me to be interested in working on a 
sequel.”</p> 
  <p>It’s not all bad news, though: “considering I went on to work 
on&nbsp;Tomb Raider and helped reimagine Lara Croft, partly because 
of&nbsp;Mirror’s Edge and Heavenly Sword, I don’t really have anything 
to&nbsp;complain about. Karma has a way of sorting things 
out…eventually!”</p> 
  <p>We spoke briefly about her father, Terry Pratchett. Did having 
such&nbsp;a famous author as a father influence her at all? “I’m not 
sure how&nbsp;much he influenced me to go into writing. He certainly 
didn’t actively&nbsp;encourage it. I guess it was just in the blood.”</p>

  <p>Indeed, the relationship between Rhianna and her father is 
much&nbsp;more complex than a literary dynasty: “I’m immensely proud of 
what&nbsp;my father has achieved in his career, but I see him as being 
my dad&nbsp;first and foremost, not ‘Terry Pratchett’ [the] famous 
author. He’s the&nbsp;man who built me Moomin Valley out of 
papier-mâché, taught me&nbsp;how to milk goats and who took me out of 
bed in the middle of the&nbsp;night to see glow worms and Halley’s 
comet.”</p> 
  <p>In an interview with New Statesman in 2012, Terry 
Pratchett&nbsp;declared that Discworld was “safe” in Rhianna’s hands. 
“That&nbsp;interview had many people jumping to the conclusion that I’d 
be&nbsp;continuing to write the books. I don’t have any intention of 
doing that.&nbsp;When it comes to Discworld I consider myself more of a 
caretaker,&nbsp;or a narrative gardener, than a successor – keeping 
things in line with&nbsp;what I feel my father would’ve wanted.”</p> 
  <p>“However, I will be involved with things like adaptations 
(I’m&nbsp;adapting Wee Free Men into a screenplay at the moment) and I 
am&nbsp;part of the creative team behind Terry Pratchett’s The Watch 
spin-off&nbsp;TV series. That’s where I feel my strengths lie. The books
 are sacred&nbsp;to dad.”</p> 
  <p>Concluding, I ask her what a typical working day is for her. 
As&nbsp;with many media professionals, she notes she doesn’t really 
have&nbsp;a typical day. “Typical tends to make me a little bored. I 
usually try&nbsp;and spend a few hours solid writing and then the rest 
of the time is&nbsp;spent researching, reading, answering emails and 
interviews, and&nbsp;polishing my Hearthstone skills.</p> 
  <p>“Alongside my game projects (which I can’t talk about) I’m 
currently&nbsp;finishing the first draft of Wee Free Men and also 
working on the&nbsp;Tomb Raider comics with Gail. My first screenplay, 
an adaptation&nbsp;of Janet Paisley’s novel Warrior Daughter (which I 
developed with&nbsp;funding from the BFI and Creative Scotland) is going
 out to directors&nbsp;at the moment. Exciting times!”</p>
