   <h1>How Battlefield devs learned to build an open world for Mirror's Edge Catalyst </h1>
   <div>
    <div></div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <p>Swedish developer DICE has been putting out games since the 
twilight of the Amiga, and most of them have had&nbsp;single-player 
components&nbsp;carefully constructed to be linear, 
scripted&nbsp;experiences.</p> 
  <p>So the studio’s latest, <em>Mirror’s Edge&nbsp;Catalyst</em>, is a significant departure for DICE.&nbsp;This&nbsp;revamp of the studio’s 2008 cult classic <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 does away with "levels" entirely&nbsp;in favor of a more open world 
(the "city of&nbsp;Glass") filled&nbsp;with missions and activities that
 players choose to take part in.</p> 
  <p>It’s a sign of the times, to be sure. But&nbsp;as DICE climbs into 
the sandbox of open-world game design alongside so many other big-budget
 developers, it’s interesting to study&nbsp;how the studio best known 
for <em>Battlefield</em> has adapted to meet the demands&nbsp;of open-world game production.</p> 
  <p>“It is challenging,” says design director Erik Odeldahl 
during&nbsp;a recent phone conversation.&nbsp;“We always talk about it 
as a free-roaming title, but it’s still a game where you play through a 
linear story because&nbsp;we do <em>like</em> telling linear stories.”</p> 
  <p>Odeldahl and many others on the <em>Catalyst</em> team are <em>Battlefield</em> veterans, and he acknowledges that the main storyline missions in the new <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> are tightly-scripted experiences built using lessons learned from structuring <em>Battlefield</em> campaigns. But in the space <em>between</em>
 those missions, Odeldahl says&nbsp;the design team struggled to create a
 world that was exciting to explore -- but technically possible, and not
 distracting enough to overshadow the game’s narrative.</p> 
  <p>“We're fairly used to building tight, action-packed, event-driven stories in <em>Battlefield</em>. So I think we've been trying to balance that,” he says. Since&nbsp;<em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>players
 can dip into or out of the game's main narrative at any time, the devs 
were challenged to build a single-player game that was engaging simply 
to&nbsp;<em>play.</em>&nbsp;“This game is about running, and it's about 
jumping, and it's about fighting. But it's also about finding optimal 
routes. It's about shaving off seconds or milliseconds off your time.”</p> 
  <p>The original <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> was also designed to entice 
players into searching for the best possible path through each level, 
and it worked -- to this day the game is a touchstone of the 
speedrunning community. But that’s a much more manageable proposition 
when you know you’ll be designing each level by hand, knowing exactly 
where the player will start and end -- how do you build a 
non-linear&nbsp;open world that’s optimized in the same way?</p> 
  <h2><strong>Build a rough version of the whole world, then fill&nbsp;in the details</strong></h2> 
  <p>“We couldn't leave much to chance. So what we did was we built the city using huge geometrical chunks,” says Odeldahl. The <em>Catalyst</em>
 team basically built the game’s entire world first, sculpting a rough 
city map out of primitives, then the level designers and artists went in
 and added or adjusted details over time. “So we had the whole city, 
almost all of it, built up like that...and there’s this constant 
iteration, as we try to figure out how the movement works.”</p> 
  <blockquote>
   &nbsp; 
   <h6>"Plan your world, plan your city or whatever it is you want to 
build, early -- so you get a good firm grip on whether you can actually 
build it or not."</h6> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>That alone is interesting because&nbsp;rarely do we 
see&nbsp;open-world games built to be quickly traversed by a player 
who’s highly mobile on foot, right from the get-go.&nbsp;Open-world game
 protagonists typically get larger and more bombastic as their mobility 
increases -- think sports cars and jets in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games, or the superhuman movement abilities in games like <em>Saint’s Row</em> and <em>Prototype</em>. Catalyst’s protagonist is much more humble, and nimble, in her movements -- and unlike the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> team, the designers at DICE had to make all the jumping and swinging between buildings look good in first-person.</p> 
  <p>"What we learned was that we needed to make the controls more 
responsive than the first game," says Odeldahl, because players were far
 more likely to change their minds mid-move when navigating 
the&nbsp;more open, nonlinear spaces of <em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>on the fly..</p> 
  <p>That brings with it an interesting challenge: how do you clearly 
indicate to a player which gaps they can leap, what walls they can 
climb, without distracting them from the experience?</p> 
  <p>“We use multiple different layers,” admits Odeldahl. “On one layer 
we use things like scratch marks, foot marks on walls, to show that it's
 a suitable place for players to do a vertical run up or a horizontal 
run across the wall. We also use ventilation systems and stuff, and 
basically everything of a certain height, whether it's a railing or a 
ventilation system, everything of a certain height is interactable in a 
certain way because the movement is contextual.”</p> 
  <p>The second, meta-layer is a “Runner’s Vision” mode that players can
 switch on at any time. The game then algorithmically generates a 
crimson path from the player’s location to wherever they’ve set their 
destination, highlighting traversable objects along the way.</p>

   <a shape="rect" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/db_area/images/news/274586/runnrs_vision_render.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="50_files/ba25498e-2ecf-4896-a4c8-8e04048b2ae5.jpg" name="ba25498e-2ecf-4896-a4c8-8e04048b2ae5" class="en-media"></a>
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>That means the game has to be capable of charting routes from 
anywhere in the world to anywhere else, and the world itself (which is 
totally hand-built) had to be designed and balanced so that multiple 
such routes exist. More importantly, DICE had to build it so that there 
weren’t any frustrating gaps or “dead zones” players couldn’t quickly 
move through, while also trying to make sure&nbsp;every area of the city
 felt distinct, believable and real.</p> 
  <p>“Some parts of the city we've actually rebuilt several times over, 
from scratch,"&nbsp;says Odelhahl.&nbsp;"Because we realized that okay, 
it's not readable, or it's visually not as interesting as we want it to 
be, or stuff like that.&nbsp;It's been a lot of work. And we don't have 
an immense amount of level designers or anything."</p> 
  <p>While the&nbsp;<em>Catalyst</em> design team did study telemetry 
data to track player movement patterns through the game during 
development, they&nbsp;didn’t have access to production tools capable of
 doing things like automatically generating a minimum viable number of 
player-traversable paths in a given area, or flagging gaps as being 
leapable or not.</p> 
  <h2><strong>"Other EA studios will learn, and look at what we've done"</strong></h2> 
  <p>Instead, <em>Catalyst</em> level designers had to rough up their own solutions until they got the hang of what players could and couldn’t do in-game.</p> 
  <p>“We set up all those [movement] rules fairly early, and then we 
built prefabs, brightly-colored prefabs, which we clearly marked like --
 they were basically like rulers that we could place in the world,” says
 Odeldahl. “We actually didn't have a tool that generated these things. 
We did have a lot of automatic testing though, to make sure that the 
movement system didn't break down after animation changes and stuff like
 that. We had, basically every check-in, everybody working on the 
project always runs a number of tests before they're allowed to check in
 whatever it is they're working on.”</p> 
  <p>And since the world of <em>Catalyst</em> is basically one giant “level”, the design team used prefab chunks they could pull out and work on as required.</p> 
  <p>“That way they didn't have to work directly into the level,” notes 
Odeldahl. “ And the whole city is more or less split into streaming 
zones, and as the player traverses the city, depending on where they are
 the zone they're in will stream in, and also neighbor sets. Each zone 
has its own neighbor sets that stream in based on what you can and can't
 see.”</p> 
  <p>That’s a new way of working for DICE, and Odeldahl believes the lessons learned from development of <em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>will influence the way other Frostbite devs build their own worlds.</p> 
  <p>“I'm 100 percent sure that other teams within DICE, but also 
outside of DICE, other EA studios will learn and look at what we've 
done,” he said. “And probably use it in some way, especially when it 
comes to these big, big worlds. Loading and streaming and stuff like 
that.”</p> 
  <p>For devs embarking on their own open-world games sans Frostbite, 
Odeldahl has one piece of advice: plan thoroughly,&nbsp;build early.</p> 
  <p>"Try to create the world -- in our case, a city -- as big as you 
want it to be, early. Because you don't really know, until you see that,
 if it's even possible for you to build it," he says, adding that some 
of those revisions DICE made to the&nbsp;city of Glass through 
development were done because some areas wound up being&nbsp;too small 
-- or too big.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>"As a designer, I think you should plan your world, plan your city 
or whatever it is you want to build, early --&nbsp;so you get a good 
firm grip on whether you can <em>actually</em> build it or not."</p>
