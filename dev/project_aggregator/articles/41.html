            <p>&nbsp;How cool would it be to know the process of 
world-building of those amazing maps in Battlefield series? To know the 
answer, here we have an expert, the amazing, talented and awesome Linnea
 Harrison from DICE. In this podcast we talk about world-building, 
environment design, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 4, Mirror’s Edge and lots
 of other cool stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: Thank you so much for having this podcast with me, this means a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison</strong>: Of course. It’s really fun.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> I really love your work and I 
follow your speeches and I’ve learned a lot from you and my favorite 
company of all the time DICE. So it’s really nice to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Now let me tell you a story to 
show you why DICE is so important for me. When I started working in the 
game industry as a game designer, I was hired by this company in Iran 
which was working on a&nbsp; sequel for this big budget FPS game called 
Fighting in Aden Gulf and the sequel was completely an online 
multiplayer game. Before that I had absolutely no experience in making 
games and all I knew from multiplayer games were from Battlefield 
series, so I was like, yeah battlefield veteran here, trust me with your
 game.</p>
<p>So imagine me in a room panicked cause I was slowly realizing the 
trouble I got myself into. Then… I started to do something about it, I 
said to myself, “All right, listen up man, you know how to do it, you’ve
 been playing Battlefield all your life, you just have to analyze good 
things about it and try to kind of do the same thing” so after that I 
designed the game and I designed a multiplayer map, and I was like, this
 is awesome! DICE…you better heads up.</p>
<p>So the other day I showed the map to the team and our lead programmer
 came to me and tapped me on shoulder and said: “you do realize that 
we’re not working with Frostbite, and this is not a Battlefield game and
 I’m sure as hell that here is not DICE” that reality punched me in the 
face, the map I designed was huge terrain with no boundaries and full of
 buildings.&nbsp; After that I realized it’s not only the vastness of 
the world in Battlefield that makes it so interesting, more importantly,
 it’s about environment design, it’s about how you can make a balance 
and fun map with minimum amount of tools. …. Then I started to work like
 a sane man and we released the game and it was awesome! So thank you 
DICE for saving my ass.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> (Laught) Awesome! Very great story!
 I had a look at the trailer of that game or some of the gameplay that 
you sent and it looked really interesting. I didn’t realize that 
Battlefield was so big where you live.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Yeah! It’s really, really big here and people really love it.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Thanks!</p>
<p></p><div><img src="41_files/5c5ad01f-bdb1-42d4-a6c5-3370324a5605.jpg" name="5c5ad01f-bdb1-42d4-a6c5-3370324a5605" class="en-media" width="576" height="360"></div>&nbsp;<p></p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> OK. Enough about me. I really 
want to know about your background from the very first day you were born
 until like last 30 minutes. Please tell us.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Oh god! OK. Well, I was born and 
raised in America but I have a Swedish mother and an Australian father, 
so very international. And we always played a lot of board games and I 
had computers a lot around, my parents were very computer techy! So 
early on I started exploring DOS and Tetris and bunch of other computer 
games and eventually I started getting into programming, so my parents 
wouldn’t let me play video games when I was very young so I decided that
 I would make my own video game and that would be a loophole. So I 
decided to program my first video game and that and I did that in Loglan
 which is a scripting language and it was basically everything I’ve seen
 from trailers and I heard from my friends. It had pirates fighting with
 ships and there was like swimming underwater section and then you had 
to find a map to find the treasure, point &amp; click.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> So it was a mess but I loved it. 
Eventually I started to play more video games as I got older and I 
really loved playing games where I was on a team. So I played Bad 
Company as my first Battlefield game and I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Awesome game!</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah, exactly! Just having a squad 
there, you and your friends, you what you doing, you could make a huge 
difference and it felt really awesome.</p>
<p>So as I started studying games because you know I just loved working 
with computers and I liked art work and I liked scripting so it seemed 
natural to work on the games.</p>
<p>I also fell in love with Mirror’s Edge when it came out in 2008. Such
 an iconic art style and so beautiful, so that inspired me to become an 
artist because up until that point I was doing more design and scripting
 but Mirror’s Edge really pushed it and said if you can make something 
this beautiful, you have to. So I got really inspired and I started 
applying for internships and I got my first internship at Treyarch 
working on Call of Duty: Black Ops and that was really fun working on 
the Wii version of the game and also working on Zombies which was of 
course super fun and after that I went to work at Raven and I worked on 
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, working on multiplayer there which was 
really cool. Then after that I went to Danger Close which is now DICE LA
 and we were working on Medal of Honor: Warfighter and then after that I
 moved here, worked on Battlefield 4 and Battlefield: Hardline and then 
Mirror’s Edge and now Star Wars: Battlefront. So I worked on all the big
 FPS games. I worked on Call of Duty, Medal of Honor and Battlefield so 
it feels pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: This is awesome. Have you worked on Battlefield 1?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah. I did a little bit of work on
 it. I did few months during pre-production, like three and a half 
months there but then opportunity came on to work on Mirror’s Edge and I
 had to jump on that of course</p>
<p></p><div><img src="41_files/db78262f-82a8-4f08-b70e-c45b1e4d3102.jpg" name="db78262f-82a8-4f08-b70e-c45b1e4d3102" class="en-media" width="576" height="360"></div>&nbsp;<p></p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: Do you ever miss working on third person games?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison</strong>: Do I miss them?</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: Yeah! You have worked on all the awesome FPS games.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> True, true! That’s a good point. 
Yeah, sometimes I wonder what it feels like to work on a different style
 of a game but I did some student projects when I was younger and I did 
some board game stuff and I still get to play lots of games, so I 
wouldn’t say I miss working on a different style of game but I really 
love playing other types of games as well.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: This is great! So, you’re a world builder at DICE, what exactly is that? What you do day to day?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> OK! Well, world builder is kind of 
like combination role between a level artist and level designer, so a 
world builder is someone who is kind of …They’re kind of a hybrid role, 
like they do some design, they do some arts and they’re supposed to be 
good at both but not supposed to be best at them. So we have experts in 
each area but we also have people who are kind of take on lots of 
different roles.</p>
<p>So world builders…We called it that because we created the world for 
the multiplayer maps so this was someone who would design the map and 
they would make it beautiful, so they create that world so that’s kind 
of what we do, so there is not many world builders left at DICE, it’s 
kind of moving towards having more level artist and level designers and I
 think that’s fine too as long as you work well together and we tried to
 seat next to each other and talk very often to make sure that really 
happens.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> What is the start point of your job, what do you think about before starting to build a world?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Usually a lot of our games start 
with a story. We have our writers and our creative directors, design 
directors. They are seating together and they’re coming up with what is a
 compelling story. Looking at literature, film, other games, everything 
that they read in the news. What is compelling, what is interesting. So 
it’s not necessarily looking at a setting first, it’s looking at story. I
 think that’s one of the… I mean I don’t know for sure but I think 
that’s one of the reasons they chose World War I for Battlefield I, 
because they’re really focusing on how global it was and…you know even 
though it put so many against each other in a war setting, it also 
brought a lot of countries together and it just catalyzed all this 
technology which wouldn’t have happened if they hadn’t work together 
towards a common goal. You know preferably that goal would have been 
something else but it did happen so we want to kind of highlight the 
other side of that I think and I thought that’s a really cool story of 
many countries coming together and I think that’s one of the things that
 compels us to create maps as well, so for instance in Battlefield 4 we 
were focusing a lot on Chinese front and that’s a very…or it was a very 
compelling area then because a lot of our markets, European western 
didn’t know a lot about the depth behind China and so we really took the
 opportunity to look into how vast and varied that world could be, so 
you’re seeing a lot of different types environments, you see these 
tropical islands and you see these dense forests, radio dishes and all 
kinds of stuff that you probably wouldn’t think of if someone said, you 
know, picture China, that wouldn’t be the first thing that you picture 
so I think that was one of the goals there.</p>
<p>So of course we start with…when we creating a map for instance maps 
in Battlefield 4, we actually ask the entire studio, every single person
 in studio to send their ideas, what would make a cool map? Here is the 
setting, here is the story but pick ideas for a map, so everyone could 
send one in, janitors, QA, level artists, the creator directors, 
everyone is sending ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Really!? Even janitors?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yes! Really! So we actually boiled 
it down to … we got like over 200 missions or something for map ideas 
and it had to be like presentation with some images and reference and 
like idea, like a pitch. Eventually we boiled it down and we got the 
maps that we have today. So it was a really cool way of making sure that
 everyone is contributing and everyone can feel a part of it and also 
get a lot of really diverse ideas. You’re not just pulling from ideas of
 designer or level artist, you’re also get ideas from everyone else, 
because of course everybody is playing these game, it’s not just going 
to be designers and level artists playing the game, it’s going to be 
every single person, so we want to make sure that those ideas are 
represented in games.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> WOW! Unbelievable! Where do you get inspiration from, when you are building a world?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Me personally or…</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> No, no, no, yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison</strong>: For me a lot of it has to do with… I
 watch a lot of travel blogs, like travel documentaries, So I get a lot 
of inspiration from there, I also read a lot of fiction and non-fiction,
 like biographies and so a lot of the inspiration that I try to take 
with me is the feeling of a place, not just what type of tree is there 
or what type of terrain but like how does it feel when you’re in that 
space, does it feel oppressive, does it feel open, does it feel 
explorative, exciting, is it dull. So that’s one of the things that I 
focus on when I want to get inspired for a new map.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: You know there are times when 
you want to build a real location, like a city or a town but you can’t 
go there and you don’t have access to a lot of pictures and resources. 
Like what you guys did with Battlefield 3, I don’t know if you had 
people in Iran taking photos or something, but the question is how can 
you recreate a real existing location when you don’t have access to it?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> That’s a good question. I would say
 that there are places that we don’t have access to, I did that when I 
was building a map for Mogadishu in Modern Warfare 3, because of course 
that’s a war-torn area and we couldn’t send anybody there to gather 
reference. There are lots of reference images on the web but they’re 
usually from like, news reports and they are not very holistic, right? 
They only show one side of the picture not the entire environment, so 
generally what we do there is looking for similar areas, so with 
Mogadishu there is a lot of cities and towns in north and south of 
there, which are very similar in terms of infrastructure because their 
using a lot of the same resources and the same things in terms of like 
cultural imprint on it and of course Mogadishu is more war-torn and is a
 bigger conflict point but you can imply a lot of the same stuff when it
 comes to how you building the roads and how people are getting 
electricity into their buildings or how a room is laid out.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of similarities that you can draw from either 
sister cultures like in a country nearby or from like geographical 
locations that are very similar. So generally that’s how we go about it 
if we don’t have a lot of reference from the actual place.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> This is crazy! Cause I have the 
same experience. I wanted to build maps based on Somalia and I couldn’t 
go there, so I watched a lot of Black Hawk Down and also I contacted a 
guy from Somalia which at the time was living in Morocco I think.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah…we did the same thing actually. (Laugh)</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> I sent him some photos of our 
maps and asked him if it was close to the reality or not, and he helped 
me a lot. So I think we can rely on the help of local people too.</p>

<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah exactly…I was able to talk to a
 friend of mine, her mother was from that area so I was able to ask her 
questions, so I think that’s a really great point, reach out throughout 
you network you probably know someone who’s either been there for a 
short time or some point in their life. That’s an extremely good 
resource.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> How do you balance the pace of a
 map? In Battlefield series there is this amazing dynamic for each map, 
it’s a unscripted gameplay but I can feel the speed and the feel of the 
game changes because of the changes in the map, it’s indoor, it’s 
outdoor, it’s high ground, low ground, it’s close, it’s wide open, these
 have huge effects in the way dynamic of the gameplay changes. How do 
you control the way a game is being played by designing a map?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Well, a lot of that feeling comes 
from the structure around the map, because the core gameplay is so 
sand-boxy our maps have to be quiet open and quite dynamic in order to 
respond to that. But what we tried to do is we tried to create mechanics
 that’s fun to play with, like a toy, that’s fun to play with. So for 
instance if you look at water gameplay in Battlefield 4 there is no way 
to control how the waves are moving, we just know that there will be 
waves, it’s a systemic event. So we need to make sure that it’s 
systemically fun, so it’s like a fun toy to play around with this like 
big waves chasing someone, you’re ducking under trying to control the 
boat, so it’s a lot about understanding the individual elements that 
compose the systems and the same is with like destruction and 
audio…audio is a really big thing that kind of create this pacing, 
because a lot of that is tied in to the ticket system so as the game 
starting to get closer to the game the audio changes and becomes more 
dynamic and more impactful and that tends to help to raise this feeling 
of tenseness and excitement and speed that you were talking about there.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> I think when you have more 
advanced technologies, your job is harder and one amazing feature in 
Battlefield series is the destruction, how does it affect your work, how
 do you make sure the game is still good while the initial form of it 
changes constantly?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> That’s a good question and it is 
really tough especially as we go through each new version where we keep 
adding more and more destruction, like with Battlefield 1 for instance 
they have this really huge terrain destruction as well now, so it’s just
 not the buildings that fall apart but you can like blow up holes in the
 ground as well, so it’s really hard to work with that but I think it’s 
important to remind yourself of the destroyed states, so what we tend to
 do when we’re creating these maps… you know…you put in cover, you put 
in buildings and landmarks and you have to make sure that the game is 
fun and playable when everything is destroyed and that has to do with 
how you design the destruction, so these days we have much more systemic
 destruction and it’s much more dynamic and we don’t have to… you know 
in Battlefield 4 you had to animate the building as it was collapsing 
and now it’s all systemic, it’s all dynamics so the player has all of 
the control which makes the designing around it a little bit harder but 
it’s still possible right? So what we’re doing is making sure that if a 
building get destroyed for instance, there is a basement section and 
there is still ruins of wall pieces or debris that’s large enough to 
cover and also we have this terrain destruction that makes these holes 
and if something is blowing up the building it also can destroy the 
ground so you’ll be able to create this more dynamic height in the 
ground in that area so you’ll be able to take cover.</p>
<p>So it’s a little bit, you know, it is difficult to design around and 
it is tough especially when we have like schedules to keep to, to like 
remember to go back and check if the gameplay works well when it’s 
destroyed but it is something that we definitely try to focus on and I 
think that’s the best way to do it really, is to play the game both, 
when it isn’t destroyed and when everything is destroyed and make sure 
that it’s still fun and playable.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> That’s why I love Battlefield. (Laugh)</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> (Laugh)</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Congratulations on Mirror’s Edge! I recently got the game and it’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Oh thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: I remember I wrote an article 
about Mirror’s Edge about how the environment was built to make the game
 fun and understandable while being fast paced and smooth. How do you do
 that? What’s the process of building the City of Glass?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> (Laugh), that was a really, really,
 really long process. The city, the actual ground of the city was 
initially based on an actual infrastructure of an actual city, not a 
real world city but we built up like an understanding of here is the 
main freeway and here is the off-roads, here is the industrial district 
and here is the financial district and here is the residential district 
and how do people move around that, how the buildings composed. So 
everything was kind of built on a realistic foundation in terms of the 
structure and what we did from there was…we started running in the city,
 that’s what did, we had play test where you just run from point A to 
point B. From there we started sort of carving these routes out and 
saying “This is a neat passage but there is a weird section here we need
 to smooth that out” and same came to designing our missions. We said, 
well this mission really want a lot of climbing or a lot of jumping, it 
want some sort of rhythm when you’re running, sliding and jumping and 
getting that sort of over under fluidity. So we started to designing 
spaces after the type of rhythm that you wanted to have when you were 
running which is really cool because you know, everyone always says the 
music is really cool in the City of Glass but we really found that when 
you’re running you’re kind of your own tempo and that’s why it was 
really cool that music kind of followed that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So once we got this sort of foundation for the city, like there
 was fun to get from point A to point B and we started the feeling that 
it was reaching a holistic level, we decided to pointing out landmarks 
like pulling up buildings and composing a scene in a very interesting 
way like using alleys to drive the player forward and then after we’ve 
done that, we started to add color that Mirror’s Edge is so well-known 
for so that was actually one of the last steps, was to add in color and 
use that as a way of communicating to the player both, in terms of where
 you are, what district you are in or what building is lying ahead or 
where you suppose to go. Of course certain companies in certain factions
 in the game have color associations but we also wanted districts and 
specific mission types to have color associations as well, so you start 
to run out of colors pretty fast but I think it helped a lot in terms of
 readability.</p>

<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: Yeah, and it helps to navigate the player, to go through the right path.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Do you play games often? What was the last inspiring game you’ve played?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison</strong>: Oh yes! Inspiring game!...Oh…let’s 
see, well I’m really enjoying Overwatch right now, it’s an incredibly 
fun game but before that I would say I really enjoyed Uncharted 4.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: Amazing game!</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah, and I heard there was a darker version of the game and I’m kind of curious to see what that was…</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Really?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah, the writer, she originally 
had written a much darker version for Uncharted 4 like it supposed to be
 the ending of Uncharted series of course but they decided to go with a 
more light-hearted approach. I’m really curious to see what this darker 
version is, because The Last of Us was quite dark at times and I’m 
curious to see how would they do that with Uncharted.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: I think Uncharted…especially The
 Uncharted 4 was good, it didn’t need to be darker, it’s like Indiana 
Jones, but Last of Us obviously… The last great game I played was Inside
 and it was absolutely masterpiece</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah!?</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: Very, very dark and very, very philosophical game.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> I’ve been thinking about picking it up but I don’t think I’m in a right mood yet, you know? (Laugh)</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar</strong>: It’s great! It’s like two hours, give it a try. It’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> It’s good! All right.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> And today I got Deus Ex, so …goodbye social life!</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Very nice…very nice. And soon the Battlefield 1 beta is coming out, so there goes my life. (Laugh)</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> (Laugh) any last words for the people who want to be a world builder like you?</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> I would say just pick up an engine 
and give it a try, you don’t even need to do it in videogames, you can 
do it in board games as well, so whatever your medium is that inspires 
you, go ahead and get started doing it, you don’t have to wait for any 
magical moment. Just get started, start building worlds and have fun.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> I remember I was making maps in Google Sketch-Up, didn’t have any engine, so…just do it, just do it.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Thank you so much. Your awesome, and your games are awesome. On my behalf, tell the guys at DICE that their awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Oh I will. Thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p><strong>Hamidreza Nikoofar:</strong> Thank you so much and goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Linnea Harrison:</strong> Goodbye!</p></div></div></div><br></div></body></html>
