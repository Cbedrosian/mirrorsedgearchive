   <h2>Building The Impossible</h2> 
   <h3>The Art Of <strong>Mirror’s Edge</strong></h3> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <p>he best possible reason for a sequel isn’t to build upon success, 
but to build upon the right kind of failure. Mirror’s Edge is not a 
great game, but Mirror’s Edge 2 could be incredible. DICE’s 
ultra-desirable anti-FPS may have stumbled in the execution, but the 
need for such a game seems more urgent than ever. It was an embattled 
project faced with early Unreal Engine 3 code and changing expectations 
(at EA) of its role. But its bleached and blown-out vision of a future 
surveillance society is perhaps, still, the best implementation of 
Epic’s ubiquitous technology to date.</p> 
   <p>Much of the credit for that belongs to prodigal environment artist
 Robert Briscoe, who this year gave us a masterful remake of 
thechineseroom’s Dear Esther. Clearly a man who thrives upon games where
 scenery dictates action, he has now delivered three of the most 
memorable venues ever: the quietening Hebrides of Esther; The Shard, the
 sky-piercing mirage at the heart of Mirror’s Edge; and the world’s only
 gorgeous storm drain (Mirror’s Edge again). It’s not the most obvious 
path for a military hardware specialist to take – but then again…</p> 
   <p>“I literally didn’t want to see another bloody tank, plane or 
warship again in my life,” he begins, recalling his previous job as a 
modeler for military recognition systems. “One of my friends who worked 
on a mod with me was working on Battlefield: Bad Company, and got me the
 interview at DICE. I was pretty sure I was going to go and work on that
 but, towards the end of the interview, they mentioned this new IP 
coming up. I was sceptical but they were looking for environment 
artists, so I thought it could be all right.”</p> 
   <p>Details were not forthcoming until after Briscoe signed on; 
Mirror’s Edge was a secretive and risky venture from the outset, 
something the old demoscene DICE might have dreamt up before 
Battlefield, EA, and the withering global recession.</p>

  </div> 
  <div> 
   <p>irror’s Edge was “basically just an art test at this point, set in
 Shanghai or somewhere very much like it,” recalls Briscoe. “It looked 
cool, but generic.” There were rooftops, but not until two months after 
Briscoe joined did art director Johannes Soderqvist, returning from 
holiday in Spain, think to plaster them all in, well, “this brilliant 
white plaster you get over there. He took all these pictures of it; he 
was fascinated by the light and the colours bouncing around. The clean, 
fresh look of it.</p> 
   <p>“Another part of it was that some of the 3D artists we had on the 
team tended to just block stuff out really quickly, not put any textures
 on things. And they did these really cool renders of the city, just 
detail models. He loved that as well. So those two things came together 
and that really turned the art direction around.”</p> 
   <p>Briscoe wasn’t quite sold on it, though. “I was sceptical. I was 
thinking, ‘Yeah, do we need to go completely white, though? That white? 
Because all I’d seen was just a couple of very small art tests.”</p> 
   <p>What’s more, the game was being built using a painfully early 
incarnation of Unreal Engine 3. Epic’s own Gears Of War was still in 
production; and it was around this time, you’ll remember, that hasty 
adopters like Fatal Inertia (Koei), Frame City Killer (Namco) and Too 
Human (Silicon Knights) stumbled.</p> 
   <p>“We needed to get a better lighting engine because the one we had 
with Unreal was bad,” recalls Briscoe, “Really bad. They hadn’t changed 
it since Unreal 1. We were looking at some of the Gears Of War levels at
 the time – we got hold of some of their source artwork and stuff – and 
they had thousands and thousands of lights in there just to simulate 
bounced light. They were manually placing all of them. And we just took 
one look and everyone was like, ‘There’s no bloody way in hell we’re 
spending two months doing that.’”</p> 
   <p>Help came in the form of rendering company Illuminate Labs, which 
at the time specialised in a Maya renderer – a global illumination 
lighting engine – called Turtle. After lengthy discussions, DICE 
convinced it to port the tech to Unreal as an external renderer called 
Beast (which would later appear in BioShock Infinite and the Starbreeze 
reboot of Syndicate).</p>

    <h3>Essentially a series of time trials set against a cityscape

   <p>riscoe had no advance knowledge of what he’d be working on. 
Artists were assigned to level designers already at work on the maps, 
few of which had much identity. What had stemmed from the game’s 
concept, though – ruthless cops and renegade traceurs in a high-stakes 
game of cat-and-mouse – was a projection of today’s most hubristic urban
 landscapes. “It’s almost over-developed,” says Briscoe. “It’s like 
Dubai and stuff, where you’ve got these amazing buildings that are built
 and then no one occupies them.”</p> 
   <p>And it just so happened that the biggest, proudest and coldest of 
these monuments fell into Briscoe’s lap. The Shard, a dominating 
skyscraper wired into every CCTV camera and affair in the city, was 
actually invented prior to the identically named, visually similar 
project currently underway in London’s Bridge Quarter.</p> 
   <p>“To be fair, it’s an amalgamation of architectural designs and 
stuff that were studied at the time, so there might have been an 
influence in there,” says Briscoe. “But we had this idea of what we 
wanted to do, which was this triangular, almost impossible-looking 
building just to dominate the skyline.” It was a paradox that DICE’s 
level designers, artists and concept artists had to tackle together. 
“Just a case of building the impossible, which is this kind of theme 
throughout it all.”</p> 
   <p>Much the same could be said for the London Shard, designed by 
architect Renzo Piano, which early on promised a glazed facade much like
 its virtual predecessor. This has yet to appear, however, leaving just a
 gradually rising spike of exposed cubicles and strip lights. The 
Mirror’s Edge Shard still stands alone.</p> 
   <p>“It was supposed to look like a complete mirror,” notes 
Briscoe.”There’s no real light visible throughout. It would just blend 
into the background – not completely, but like an aberration effect, 
this weird optical illusion of a mirror in the sky.”</p> 
   <p>Thanks to Half-Life 2’s Citadel, The Shard serves a familiar 
purpose. As an orienteering device, it allows Mirror’s Edge to explore a
 broad range of times and locations without losing its sense of 
geography. You can see it from just about anywhere in the game – and it,
 you feel, sees all.</p> 
   <p>“It’s just one of the things that Half-Life 2 did great, giving 
you this goal from the get-go,” says Briscoe. “You get out onto the 
square and straight away you’ve this huge, ominous, looming <em>thing</em>
 in the background that you know… that’s where shit’s going down later 
on. It’s gives you a goal right away, and that’s what we wanted to with 
Mirror’s Edge. You had this hub where all of the tech was being 
monitored, where everything was being controlled. I don’t know if [DICE]
 would appreciate me saying it was a direct influence, Half-Life 2, but 
it’s not really deniable.”</p> 
   <p>Transitioning between skybox object and local map feature where 
necessary, The Shard is never closer than in Briscoe’s own ‘The Shard’, a
 closing level that finally lets you inside – to see what it sees. 
Serried rows of servers beneath gleaming, vaulted ceilings track the 
movements and histories of an entire population. And then, with nowhere 
left to run to but an abysmal anticlimax of an endgame, the rooftop 
gives you the full, unbroken view of the city at nightfall.</p> 
   <p>“One of the things I really wanted to establish at the beginning 
of that level was to just see this thing before you actually went up to 
it,” explains Briscoe. “It was really important for us to show the 
massive scale of it – in the same way that when you come out on the last
 level of Dear Esther, you see you’re finally at this huge mount with 
the aerial on top. It builds the tension up to a crescendo; you know 
you’re at the final stages.”</p> 
   <blockquote>
    <p>“The Shard would just blend into the background – not completely,
 but like an aberration effect, this weird optical illusion of a mirror 
in the sky.”</p>
   </blockquote> 
   <p>The rooftop panorama, such a complete 360 that it allows a Bon 
Jovi-worthy helicopter shot to close out the game, would be an 
extraordinary feat of skybox engineering in any game, Unreal-powered or 
not. “The guy who actually made it spent the majority of his life on it,
 I think,” says Briscoe. “It was literally the last year of the project.
 So that’s one of the reasons it looks fantastic.”</p> 
   <p>Another is because it’s not, like most videogame skyboxes, a muddy
 lo-res curtain wrapped sloppily around the map. It looks like a 
horizon, not a stage. Between Valve’s City 17 and the hypnotic coasts of
 Dear Esther, it might very well be the bridge between Briscoe’s 
inspiration and his later work.</p> 
   <p>“There was a lot of modelling in there,” he points out. “The thing
 about that rooftop was that it was fairly simple, just this small area 
that didn’t really have the environmental detail of the other rooftop 
levels. It was literally a single rooftop, which meant Chris could just 
go nuts. Most of the budget just went into that skybox alone. You can’t 
do that for every game, but it’s about getting this balance. It’s about 
putting the same amount of effort into the foreground as the 
background.”</p> 
   <p>That the events on that rooftop are a split-second flurry of 
unmitigated tosh is hard to deny. It’s Briscoe’s “biggest regret,” in 
fact, “that there was so much effort put into it by me, the level 
designer and the backdrop artist. We built up this huge gameplay 
scenario that was going to happen where you’d be chased around by all 
these guys and have to chase this helicopter around, then kick this guy 
out at the right time. But it got cut at the last minute.”</p>

   <h3>A world defined by colour, geometry and relief rather than big 
(but never big enough) diffuse textures, Mirror’s Edge has stood the 
test of time better than almost any other game of its generation.</h3> 
  </div> 
  <div> 
   <p>riscoe’s other level in Mirror’s Edge is arguably more powerful 
than even The Shard, staged around and throughout a quite awesome storm 
drain. Furthermore, unlike The Shard, this one is very much rooted in 
reality.</p> 
   <p>G-Cans – or, to give it a somehow less glamorous name, the 
Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel – is a distinctly 
Japanese vanity project designed to protect Tokyo from flooding during 
the monsoon season. Costing $2bn and home to over 100km of tunnels, it 
lures in urban adventurers from around the world to see its ‘Underground
 Temple’, a cavernous pillared storage tank literally dripping with 
atmosphere.</p> 
   <p>Most recently it appeared in the egregiously repetitive survival 
horror game Fragile, the saving grace of which was a funereal parade of 
such places linked by a story of post-apocalyptic companionship. Being a
 Wii game, though, Fragile can only imply what Briscoe’s version 
delights in: the unique behaviour of light in a place recently visited 
by water. Again, it’s not hard to draw parallels with Dear Esther’s 
refurbished Cave level.</p> 
   <blockquote>
    <p>“I was like, ‘What the fuck is it?’ And he said it was a sewer. 
And I said, ‘What the hell have they been eating over there? Is it that 
bad?’”</p>
   </blockquote> 
   <p>“Me and the level designer were just brainstorming ideas and were 
literally looking at stuff – architecture – from Tokyo, Korea, 
Shanghai…” says Briscoe. “And one of my mates just sent me one of these 
images of this huge… You know, the shot with the pillars.</p> 
   <p>“I was like, ‘What the fuck is it? What is it?’ And he said it was
 a sewer. And I said, ‘What the hell have they been eating over there? 
Is it that bad?’ It took us a while to find out what the name of the 
bloody thing was, but we found it and it was like, ‘That has got to go 
in.’ It really speaks to the kind of weird, semi-futuristic architecture
 that was in the game at the time. And the other opportunity it 
presented was really good vertical gameplay within an indoor 
environment. We could get a really good feeling of vertigo but not have 
it be an office building or something boring like that.</p> 
   <p>“And, as an artist, for me it was just brilliant. It was something
 I knew I’d just love to work on. So, we belted out some ideas. It took a
 long time to get some gameplay together for that, just because it’s 
such a big room. But it was a bit of creative twisting of reality in 
there, with all the scaffolding and stuff. That was one area of the game
 that I worked on that I was really pleased with in the end.”</p> 
   <p>These levels weren’t just blank canvases for the artists, either. 
Briscoe and his colleagues would join their allotted level designers to 
find a timeline of levels with broad mechanical, if not visual, themes. 
“I think level two started out as this big hole in the ground that you 
travelled down into, going through all these tunnels and stuff. But 
there wasn’t any real predefined thing before we started building.”</p> 
   <p>Something else that threatens to literally strike you in the storm
 drain are the walls and floor: they’re beautifully textured. Mirror’s 
Edge owes much of its endurance to the fact that it’s not another 
‘consolitis’-afflicted charnel house of compressed and neglected 
surfaces. It’s immaculate, just like its city.</p> 
   <p>“The secret of that was that we had these basically monochrome 
textures. We could get away with a lot because it’s mostly just black 
and white,” says Briscoe. “And, in a similar way to Dear Esther, you’ve 
not necessarily got detailed textures but this perceived detail, this 
impression, which is what’s really important. We could do small tricks 
like having high-res normal maps but a low-res diffuse map which didn’t 
have much detail on, but you could get away with it because of the 
normal map. And of course a lot of areas were really bright, slightly 
blown out, so again you’re hiding it.</p> 
   <p>“A lot of textures were reused as well because they’re so basic. 
All the building textures, we just reused them all over the place 
because we didn’t have to worry about different material types. We 
didn’t have to worry about concrete not being the right colour for 
concrete, or enamel not being enamel. In a lot of places it was just 
plain white textures – there wasn’t even a diffuse used. And we used a 
lot of tricks in the textures, even going as far as to use one channel 
of the actual diffuse for the specular, another for the alpha.”</p>

   <p>t’s these little tricks and shortcuts – knowing when to use new 
and expensive techniques versus old, cheap ones – that have separated 
the good and the ugly of the last ten years. Trapped within the same 
console hardware for approaching seven of them, games have progressed 
through reduction and economy. Mirror’s Edge, a game defined by almost 
hyper-realistic lighting, got it right first time, choosing baked static
 lighting throughout.</p> 
   <p>“A lot of people don’t realise that if you ever use dynamic 
shadows or lighting, that’s a massive, massive chunk of memory gone 
straight away. Because you have to render the whole scene to an 
uncompressed, huge texture. So we had that extra memory there,” explains
 Briscoe. “We also did a lot more work on putting detail into the actual
 polygons, rather than the textures themselves, which is a philosophy 
I’ve taken away with me. Vertices on a model cost nothing; mesh memory 
is nothing compared to texture memory. And you see in a lot of games 
they have these flat walls with air ducts and things, and they’re just 
normal maps. I just think, why not just model it? It’s a hell of a lot 
cheaper and it’ll look a hell of a lot better up close.</p> 
   <p>“And you see these other games that have normal maps on every 
single surface, so you’ve got a grass texture which looks like porridge 
because you don’t need a normal map on grass. You can’t do it, it 
doesn’t work. So we used normal maps and specularity quite sparingly 
where we could, and that’s something I took over to Dear Esther. The 
only level I really extensively used normal maps in was the Cave level.”</p> 
   <p>Briscoe is “really irked” by this stuff, and it’s not hard to see 
why. Games with beautifully high-res diffuse textures and tiny normal 
maps are just one example of such crass optimisation, others simply 
misspending their budgets and basically vomiting the results in your 
face. Briscoe suggests we call it “the Skyrim effect,” though surely 
there’s a better ring to simply ‘the Mass Effect’.</p> 
   <p>“I hate to use the word but it tends to be what I’d call 
‘consolitis’. It’s a bit of a swearword, but it’s people not putting 
enough effort into the console version. They’ve just lowered their 
texture resolution to fit it in memory. Or you find a paint bucket that 
has a really high-resolution normal and specular map, and you think: 
why? It’s a bucket. It’s about consistency, giving priority to what 
needs decent textures and what doesn’t.”</p>

   <p>he worst you can say about Mirror’s Edge is that it’s simply not 
very good, or that it’s simply brilliant or awful. It’s too complex a 
scenario for any of that, its flaws residing in the molecular chemistry 
of its pacing, signposting, innovative POV and accompanying control 
scheme. Well, most of its flaws are that subtle. Then there are the 
cutscenes.</p> 
   <p>Briscoe howls, “Oh, don’t tell me about those. Honestly. We 
couldn’t really believe it when we got those back. I was opposed to the 
whole idea of these e-surance style animations in the first place. I 
think they just thought to outsource the animation because it could be a
 really cool thing. It could look really different. But it just turned 
out to be, ‘What the fuck?’ I don’t think there’s a single person on 
that team who’ll say those are cool.</p> 
   <blockquote>
    <p>“Mirror’s Edge wasn’t really my cup of tea when it came out. I 
sat down and played it on PS3 for about an hour and that was it, I gave 
up. Didn’t like it.”</p>
   </blockquote> 
   <p>“It’s a total contrast to the actual game, and not in a good way. 
It’s like you’re watching Game Of Thrones and a commercial for Kellogg’s
 Frosties comes on. ‘That’s it, I’m getting a cup of tea.’</p> 
   <p>“Early on in the game we had these prototype cutscenes which were 
all firstperson. Completely firstperson: a little bit like the ending 
cutscene but a lot more choreographed, a lot more polished. It was 
really amazing. But I think it was just a case of time. We had to get 
out and compete, for some reason, with Gears Of War 2, Uncharted, and 
all these other titles that were coming out. All these sequels. We were 
pushed and pushed and pushed, and more and more stuff had to be cut.”</p> 
   <p>This is Mirror’s Edge in a nutshell, really. Green-lit as part of a
 bold new IP drive by EA chairman John Riccitiello – “they used to call 
him ‘JR’” – it was suddenly a bit too bold for the company’s bean 
counters. That nasty habit of maximising sales rather than concept, to 
which we owe Dead Space 2’s incongruous multiplayer mode, became 
something of a personality disorder for DICE’s ultra-niche platformer – 
and it was contagious.</p> 
   <p>“There was this pressure to deliver within a short amount of time 
because it was costing a lot of money,” reveals Briscoe, “and again it 
was a huge risk. And I think it was a case of nobody being really sure 
what they were capable of in the time that they had. There were 
decisions made that were just questionable. Me and the level designer 
would sit there and get a level looking really good, and the next day 
you’d come in and there’d be snipers everywhere. People wanted it more 
intense, not really seeing the bigger picture of pacing and stuff like 
that.</p> 
   <p>“So, it wasn’t really my cup of tea when it came out. I sat down 
and played it on PS3 for about an hour and that was it, I gave up. 
Didn’t like it. There were all these gameplay decisions going on that I 
wasn’t happy with, but as an artist it was like, ‘Well, I’ve got no 
control over that so I’m just going to make it as good looking a game as
 I can.’ And, luckily, the art designers and level designers were some 
of the best I’ve worked with.”</p> 
   <p>There was, furthermore, a tension right at the heart of what 
Mirror’s Edge involves: free-running… or should that be parkour? Was 
this a game about pondering the environment (arguably the former) or 
beating it (arguably the latter)? Was it open world or linear time 
trial? Was it, ultimately, the game DICE imagined from the start?</p> 
   <p>“The open world thing was something we really wanted to do, one of
 the early things we kind of dreamed about doing,” says Briscoe. “But it
 became obvious early on that it just – as far as getting it on the 
consoles was concerned – wasn’t going to be possible. One of the first 
things we had to do was just tackle the Unreal Engine, because no one in
 the company had really worked with it before. But towards the end we 
really got this solid engine together. If it had kept going and if 
they’d kept working on Mirror’s Edge, it could have easily gone in [an 
open world] direction. It’s just a case of what our original goals were 
and what we could actually achieve. They were separated towards the 
end.”</p>

  </div> 
  <div> 
   <p>rop-kicking the villainous Jackknife out of a helicopter and into 
gaming’s hall of eternal shame – right next door to the last half-hour 
of BioShock – wasn’t the last of Mirror’s Edge, sequel or no sequel. A 
series of unlockable Time Trial levels sought to purify the game 
somewhat, turning it into a more appetising sport. It was a 
half-measure, though, as much an attempt to recover abandoned level 
designs, recycle existing ones, and add something – anything – to the 
meagre few hours of singleplayer story. Then this happened…</p> 
   <p>“At the end the project, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 was entering 
crunch time and the whole team went to either that or Battlefield 3,” 
recalls Briscoe. “So most of the team went off and was dissolved between
 those two. But EA wanted DLC from the get-go, because it was really 
kicking off and making loads of money. That was where a lot of the 
revenue could come in.</p> 
   <p>“We had two or three level designers, if that, and one artist: me.
 At least at first. And I was like, ‘Okay. So, you want me to make seven
 time trial maps on a similar scale to some of the other levels which 
took one artist two years to make, and you want me to do it in three 
months?’ I think it was even less. I just said to Johannes, “Look, it’s 
not going to happen, it’s just impossible. We need to go back to the 
drawing board a bit here and just think about doing something in the 
spirit of Mirror’s Edge, but a lot simpler.”</p> 
   <p>The result, Pure, is extraordinary. It’s just Mirror’s Edge 
heroine Faith, essentially, dropped into the centrifuge of Briscoe’s 
imagination. Story and reality are separated and removed, leaving 
textures, geometry and light. It is the unlikeliest of art games, made 
in guerilla fashion by one of the biggest studios in the world. 
Demoscene stuff, you might say. Classic DICE.</p> 
   <p>“We had the training level in the game already, this huge room 
with just blocks and stuff. So we talked about doing this whole thing of
 maybe having arenas like that. But again it had to be cut down because 
there just weren’t the resources to design and build these rooms. So 
Johannes went away for a while and thought about it, and we talked it 
over with [the Mirror’s Edge] concept artist, Pierre Hannah. And he came
 up with a few sketches of this weird, abstract landscape. I loved it. 
It was perfect.</p> 
   <p>“We had this idea of just themes for each level. One was pure 
cubes, another was obtuse angles and conflicting geometry, and another 
was just streamline geometry – curves and things like that. We basically
 invented this material that could just be used on brushwork in the 
game, to apply textures without worrying about alignment or anything; it
 would just fit. I think it was probably one of the coolest things I’ve 
worked on.”</p> 
   <p>Briscoe’s memories of Mirror’s Edge remind us, like the game 
itself, that game appreciation is not an exact science. There are no 
metrics for the people who buy games like Rage (Briscoe: “Don’t even get
 me started on that”), Mass Effect and even ArmA for something other 
than the critical path. To a great many, DICE’s game is a work of art. 
To Rob Briscoe, the time he spent on it made him what he is today.</p> 
   <blockquote>
    <p>“So, you want me to make seven time trial maps on a similar scale
 to some of the other levels which took one artist two years to make, 
and you want me to do it in three months?”</p>
   </blockquote> 
   <p>“DICE has a massive bar that they like to stick to,” he says. “The
 quality consistency is a very important thing over there. They just 
won’t release something unless they’re… I think Battlefield 3 was in its
 third iteration of Frostbite 2 when I was there, and there were two 
other iterations by the time I’d left. The art directors there are, 
without a doubt, some of the most talented I’ve seen, and the artists 
are also amazing. I was absolutely out of my depth when I went there.</p> 
   <p>“‘What the hell am I doing?’ I thought. ‘I’ve got all these 
amazing people around me.’ But being around that quality and talent 
really drives you to do better and improve yourself. One of the things 
I’ve learned is that is you slack out on one element – if you can’t be 
bothered with the skybox; if you just want to make everything look great
 from a distance… I’d have trouble going back to a company that has 
different philosophies on those things.”</p>
