  <p>Despite the original <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> game being praised for 
its clean minimalist aesthetic in 2008, one of the common bugbears that 
many had with the game was its frustrating parkour movement in a world 
that suffered from frustrating level design. Despite these factors 
playing a huge part in curbing the game’s sales potential, DICE were 
still able to convince Electronic Arts to give the studio one more 
chance at rectifying the game’s core problems whilst also building upon 
its many strengths. And with a reboot allowing the team at DICE to wipe 
the slate clean, <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> is a game that DICE hope finally lives up to the franchise’s potential. I spoke to Erik Odeldahl (Design Director of <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>)
 about this where he talked about how the game was a labour of love for 
DICE and why more people should give the franchise a second chance upon 
the game’s release in May 2016. </p> 
  <p></p>
  <div>

  <p></p> 
  <p><strong>You’ve probably been asked this about billion times before, but why did you decide to name the game <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> and is it a prequel or a sequel [to the first game]?</strong></p> 
  <p>It’s a reboot of the whole game. We took the themes that we love 
from the first game. We have the beautiful city, the wonderful art 
direction, Faith [Connors] the Runner, the first person parkour… 
Basically, we took all those themes, but we wanted to rebuild the game 
on a stronger base and have a richer lore and have more texture to the 
world. Just have more depth to the world and what it does to people who 
live in this world. It’s not a sequel so that’s why we didn’t want to 
call it <em>Mirror’s Edge 2</em>.</p> 
  <p><strong>The game delves into Faith’s back story where it almost 
implies that it’s a prequel. Given the fact that Faith’s history is 
being emphasized in such a dramatic way where the game places a lot of 
importance on Faith as a female character, does that maybe signify 
Electronic Art’s attempt to get more female gamers into gaming, or 
ensure that the sexes are a little bit more equally represented? Because
 if you think about it, Faith’s quite strong as a character and she’s 
not one of those brainless bimbos as it were…</strong></p> 
  <p>She’s a super strong character. I’m not sure that it’s a conscious 
decision to get more women to play. Everybody on the [development] team 
believes in diversity. We want everybody to play this. Personally, I 
find it really stupid to just focus on one segment, and it’s a waste to 
just blindly focus on one segment of your player base. Games are great 
for everybody, right? Faith is a woman, and she’s a super strong 
character, and that’s just part of what the game is. It’s not a 
conscious decision to attract more women. It’s just to attract more 
players.</p> 
  <p><strong>So it’s not like <em>FIFA</em> where you’ve gotten female 
players on board… I understand that EA is a massive company and that 
you’ve got shareholders to take care of, but this whole Gamergate thing,
 especially with the whole issue of excluding and / or including women, 
that’s obviously had bearings with the inclusion of female players as 
part of <em>FIFA 16</em>. Because of the timing, you could almost argue 
that there are Gamergate related politics involved as part of the 
industry’s attempt to maybe appear to be a little bit more progressive 
than it actually is. With so much emphasis being placed on Faith and her
 backstory, which obviously implies that you’re fleshing her out as a 
character, is this your way “in” of trying to legitimize female game 
characters and even gaming in general?</strong></p> 
  <p>I’ve followed Gamergate from a distance. I believe in equality. I 
also believe that you shouldn’t treat people like shit regardless of 
what your opinion is. The fact that we’re creating a rich backstory for 
Faith is mainly because we want to create a rich backstory for the main 
character. We would have done the same thing for a male character. In 
fact we have rich backstories from most of our characters in the game. 
It’s not something we’ve done just because she’s a woman.</p>

  <p></p> 
  <p><strong>Faith doesn’t have the ability to use guns in <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>. Can you please explain why, and is this Electronic Arts’ attempt to maybe “sterilize” its future gaming products?</strong></p> 
  <p>First of all, using guns didn’t fit with the Faith character that 
we’ve created for this game. It just didn’t fit. We didn’t want her to 
use guns. Also, guns and first person shooters are often games that 
while you’re shooting, you tend to stand still way more than Faith is 
doing. <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> is a game about momentum. It’s a game of 
just continuously propelling yourself forward and chaining moves 
together, and we wanted combat to reflect that too. That’s another 
reason we removed the guns. We wanted Faith and the players to get up 
close to the enemies and basically knock them on the head. So first of 
all, from a gameplay reason, we didn’t want the player to stop. We 
didn’t want to have flow breakers like that. And the second big reason 
is that it didn’t fit with the story we wanted to tell about Faith.</p> 
  <p><strong>The first game was criticized for its clunky parkour movement. With games like <em>Brink</em> and <em>Dying Light</em> taking the parkour concept and building upon and even possibly perfecting it… in what way is the rebooted <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> taking steps to address the control issues that the first original <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> game suffered from?</strong></p> 
  <p>We’ve rebuilt the movement system from the ground up. Our 
intention, and we’re delivering on, is to make a system that is way more
 responsive than any other game out there. It’s something that we’ve 
continuously worked on. We want the game to be as responsive, smooth, 
and as unrestrictive as possible. If it looks like you should be able to
 jump or go somewhere, get out of a move, you should be able to. It’s 
been a core philosophy for us to have it be as responsive and as smooth 
as possible. It’s the core of our game. If the movement doesn’t work 
then nothing else really matters.</p>

  <p></p> 
  <p><strong>You are the Design Director for <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>, but you’re not the original director from the original <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>. Does the original director have any influence at all in terms of how the reboot has manifested itself?</strong></p> 
  <p>We still talk, and we discuss designs, like I did with lots of 
other people at DICE. DICE is a big company and people move about 
between teams all the time. Of course, yes. We talk and I listen. He’s 
got opinions. I’ve got opinions. We have other members from the original
 team on our team. We have a rich discussion at DICE about what the game
 is supposed to be. We absolutely talk.</p> 
  <p><strong>Even though <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> had its problems, it was
 still a game that received a lot of love from a certain niche segment 
within the market. I assume it did well enough [commercially] hence the 
reason why it’s getting a reboot, but I also know that DICE had a lot of
 love for its <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> creation. Given that Electronic Arts is a public trading company that answers to shareholders, and given that <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 wasn’t as successful as Electronic Arts hoped for it to be the first 
time round, what steps did you and DICE have to take in order to 
persuade Electronic Arts to give you a second chance, especially with <em>Catalyst</em> being a reboot?</strong></p> 
  <p>Everybody at DICE loves <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> and it shows in what
 we do. Everybody felt that this concept that we had was really strong. 
It was the right time, the right concept, and a lot of pieces just came 
together. So here we are.</p> 
  <p><strong>What lessons have you learnt from the first game to ensure 
that the reboot is as strong a product as it can be when it does launch?</strong></p> 
  <p>We played the first game to death and there were a lot of really 
good things about it. We got lots of feedback on the first game about 
people wanting to explore. People wanted to be able to choose more 
freely on where to go and what to do. That’s one of the core 
philosophies for <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> where there’s not just 
one path to a location. There are multiple paths. You can choose when to
 do it. Also working on the movement system to make it more responsive. 
And finally, to have a richer story with more texture and with more life
 in it. I think those are the things.</p> 
  <p><strong>Are you using the Frostbite 3 engine [to develop the game]?</strong></p> 
  <p>We’re building the game on Frostbite 3. That gives us an 
opportunity to do some things that would have been harder with the old 
engine.</p> 
  <p></p>

  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p><strong><em>Catalyst</em> looks graphically phenomenal. It looks 
beautiful. It’s been able to retain the clean minimalist aesthetic of 
the first game but still have all these crazy effects that could only 
really be possible with our current generation systems. With that being 
said however, given that a typical game’s production values are so much 
more higher in order for it to live up to current-gen standards, and 
with the original game not being as successful as Electronic Arts hoped 
for it to be, in what way has EA’s expectations in terms of financial 
and production assistance been tempered? Because ultimately, the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> franchise is not <em>Battlefield</em>. It’s not <em>Star Wars</em>. It’s a second chance. Otherwise you’d be building upon the first game’s legacy by calling it a sequel quite confidently.</strong></p> 
  <p>You can call it a “second chance”. The first game was actually quite successful over the long run…</p> 
  <p><strong>“Over the long run”. But given the Electronic Arts is a 
public company, ultimately the shareholders want their money now. Is 
that true or not?</strong></p> 
  <p>To be honest, I don’t have any insight on that so I wouldn’t know.</p> 
  <p><strong>The first <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> game had quite a high 
production value in relation to whatever the benchmark was for games 
coming out for consoles at the time. According to [time and technology] 
scales, how high are the [relative] production values for <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> [on this occasion]?</strong></p> 
  <p>I can’t talk about money or budgets like that, but we’ve been working on it for quite a while. We’ve got a good-sized team.</p> 
  <p><strong>Yes, that’s the thing… I know that you guys have been 
working on it for quite a while and I also know that it’s a labor of 
love. And when something is a labor of love, you don’t get paid for it. 
Does that make sense? One reason as to why people liked the first <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> game, despite its clunkiness, was because you could feel the passion, and that’s something that money can’t buy.</strong></p> 
  <p>I think there’s room for all kinds of games, and I think it’s good 
for a studio to have a diverse portfolio. It’s good for game developers 
at a studio to have different types of projects to work on. I’ve 
personally worked on several <em>Battlefield</em> games and <em>Medal of Honor</em>.
 Doing something like this, it basically lets you exercise your design 
muscles for different types of genres and different types of games. <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> is a project we love just like we love <em>Battlefront</em>. There’s room for different types of projects at one studio.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Battlefield 4</em> launched with a myriad of problems. 
The game was fundamentally broken in many ways, and Electronic Arts / 
DICE issued a public statement stating that every single member of 
[DICE’s] staff was put on <em>Battlefield 4</em> post-launch to ensure 
that the problems were fixed and that consumers would be satisfied with 
their £40 purchase. It’s a reputation thing where reputation in this 
industry is everything. Nintendo have shown that a company can’t rely on
 a 10 year old reputation, which explains as to why they are where they 
are right now [with their abysmal success of the Wii U]. But when every 
single person in DICE has worked on <em>Battlefield 4</em>, and <em>Star Wars Battlefront</em> only just came out two years later… Given that all those people worked on <em>Battlefront</em> in order to ensure that it shipped on time, in what way has the production for <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>
 been affected over these years? It can’t be that many people who have 
consistently worked on the game as DICE’s resources have needed to go 
towards games that have kept the lights on and have paid the bills. I 
understand that [as a franchise] <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> is a commercial product, but it’s not the golden goose, which is why it required a reboot…</strong></p> 
  <p>Maybe… We helped out. I personally helped out on <em>Battlefield 4</em>
 to fix stuff. It’s what we do. We come together as a studio because 
it’s our games and we want our games to be good. We want them to be 
stable. It’s a matter of pride as well. Everybody comes together to fix 
things. That’s one of the good things at a studio like DICE. When we 
need to, we work together and we fix things. <em>Battlefield 4</em> turned really, really good in the end.</p> 
  <p><strong>I’m speculating that the game may have had cutbacks in 
terms of its production budget relative to all other AAA games coming 
out on today’s consoles. What I’d like to ask is how has <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>‘s development been affected by <em>Battlefield 4</em> and its associated problems, as well as the pressures that EA faced in ensuring that <em>Star Wars Battlefront</em> shipped on time?</strong></p> 
  <p>I can’t really comment on that. I’m sorry. I can’t do that.</p> 
  <p><strong>Going forward, how will <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> be supported? Will there be any DLC?</strong></p> 
  <p>We’re not talking about that yet.</p> 
  <p><strong>What are your hopes for the franchise if <em>Catalyst</em> is successful? If there is a sequel, would we be seeing a sequel to <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> or would it be a sequel to the original game?</strong></p> 
  <p>I really hope people like this. I would really like to make more games in this new universe we’re building. <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>
 is definitely the start and that’s the ground-work. That’s what we’re 
going to build on and that’s what we’re going from in the future.</p> 
  <p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

        <p>The interview “technique” on display here requires a serious 
overhaul. I get the impression the interviewer was attempting to ask 
“hard hitting” questions. Instead, they let their agenda take over and 
fired one loaded question after another. That anyone could ask them with
 a straight face is baffling.</p> 
        <p>I’m honestly surprised Erik even bothered to continue, but 
I’m glad he did; his answers (in spite of the truly terrible, leading 
questions) were great to read.</p>
