  <p>INT. BUSINESS MEETING – ELECTRONIC ARTS</p> 
  <p>PUBLISHER ELECTRONIC ARTS</p> 
  <p>(lighting a cigar with a $100 bill)</p> 
  <p>DEVELOPER DICE</p> 
  <p>I know you guys want us to make infinitely more Battlefield games. 
But in the meantime, how about you let us try something fresh and 
interesting?</p> 
  <p>PUBLISHER ELECTRONIC ARTS</p> 
  <p>Like what?</p> 
  <p>DEVELOPER DICE</p> 
  <p>A first-person platformer focused on free running and jumping rather than gunplay.</p> 
  <p>PUBLISHER ELECTRONIC ARTS</p> 
  <p>Ha ha ha, who the fuck would want to play Xen as a full game?</p> 
  <p>(beat)</p> 
  <p>Oh wait, you’re serious.</p> 
  <p>DEVELOPER DICE</p> 
  <p>Yes. We actually have most of our assets ready. All we need is a writer to loosely string them together with a story.</p> 
  <p>PUBLISHER ELECTRONIC ARTS</p> 
  <p>Alright then. But you get right back on the Battlefield when you’re done! What number are we on again?</p> 
  <p>DEVELOPER DICE</p> 
  <p>2142.</p> 
  <p>PUBLISHER ELECTRONIC ARTS</p> 
  <p>Which is it, 21 or 42?</p> 
  <p>DEVELOPER DICE</p> 
  <p>No no, this one is set in the <em>year</em> 2142.</p> 
  <p>PUBLISHER ELECTRONIC ARTS</p> 
  <p>FADE TO:</p> 
  <p>EXT. GENERIC CITY</p> 
  <p>After the BLOOM CLEARS, we see an UNNAMED FUTURISTIC CITY which looks like it was designed entirely by APPLE.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS (O.S.)</p> 
  <p>Boy, things sure haven’t been the same since the government became 
totalitarian and started monitoring all electronic communications. Good 
thing there’s runners like me hand-delivering clandestine items and 
messages for faceless revolutionary groups.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY contacts FAITH over a RADIO FREQUENCY which the GOVERNMENT apparently can’t monitor.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Nice expository voice-over, Faith, but it’s time to get to work. 
That injury you had a while back totally warrants a mandatory tutorial 
level.</p> 
  <p>FAITH plays tag with CELESTE, a FELLOW RUNNER.</p> 
  <p>CELESTE</p> 
  <p>Hey, Faith! What’s up?</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Your hair, obviously. Why do you look like the cheerleader skank in any given teen comedy?</p> 
  <p>CELESTE</p> 
  <p>Catch me, Faith! Tee-hee!</p> 
  <p>CELESTE trains FAITH, who then has to deliver a PACKAGE.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>You do realise you have no idea what you’re carrying, right? It 
could be vials of anthrax for all you know. Maybe the government has a 
right to be totalitarian.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>No, I am helping freedom because an opinion said so!</p> 
  <p>A TRAINING PROMPT tells FAITH to RUN AWAY FROM HOSTILES. This 
informs her that there are HOSTILES up ahead, even though they’re 
actually COPS.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I mean, look at these authority figures! No individuality among them, they all look the same!</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>I think that’s because there’s only two different character models between them.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>No, they’re all conformists!</p> 
  <p>FAITH outruns the COPS, delivers the PACKAGE and ESCAPES.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC CUTSCENE</p> 
  <p>FAITH returns to MERCURY’S HIDEOUT, where she builds a HOUSE OF CARDS as a METAPHOR for the GOVERNMENT, surely.</p> 
  <p>DEVELOPER DICE</p> 
  <p>Did you notice how we rendered this beautiful and mesmerising 
cityscape? Well, we’re going to throw it all out in favour of bland, 
two-dimensional cutscenes!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>So now I lack depth in more than one way.</p> 
  <p>A POLICE SCANNER mentions a DISTRESS CALL from her SISTER, KATE.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I must get to her before the police does!</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Isn’t your sister a cop herself?</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>EXACTLY!</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC OFFICE</p> 
  <p>FAITH arrives at an OFFICE where she finds KATE all alone next to a CORPSE.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Whoa, the police around here must be really inept if I’m the first 
to actually respond to your distress call. Which I had to intercept.</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Faith, you shouldn’t have come. This guy’s been shot with my gun. I’m being set up!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Who is he?</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Don’t you read the news?</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>It’s not news anymore, it’s advertising.</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Wow, thanks for being all supportive with that remark about media outlets being mere tools of the totalitarian government.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>So totalitarian.</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Anyway, he’s Robert Pope, the only one who could politically stand against our evil, evil mayor!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>You have to run, Kate. Run! RUUUUUUN! WHY ARE YOU NOT RUNNING AS WE SPEAK?</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I’m not like you, Faith! The way our parents named us pretty much guaranteed we’d end up on different sides of the law!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Then I’ll help you by running all over the place. Anything to keep from having to deliver more packages.</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Thanks, Faith. If you don’t feel like doing an interior monologue, 
you can always talk to my superior, Lieutenant Miller. He can be 
trusted.</p> 
  <p>The POLICE arrives. FAITH escapes by FALLING 50 FEET THROUGH A GLASS CEILING and walking away UNHARMED.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Mercury, I need a plot point.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Our old friend Jacknife probably knows more about this.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC STORM DRAIN</p> 
  <p>On her way to find JACKNIFE, FAITH enters a STORM DRAIN.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Careful, Faith. A sniper team has entered the storm drain, because using long-range weapons inside a sewer makes complete sense.</p> 
  <p>SNIPER</p> 
  <p>Think I can shoot that bird as it flies away right in front of you,
 thereby indicating both my presence and my prowess with a sniper rifle?</p> 
  <p>(he does)</p> 
  <p>Fuck yeah I can!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>There was no need for that. Your laser sight gives away your position more than enough.</p> 
  <p>SNIPER</p> 
  <p>Yeah, we can’t seem to ever turn those off.</p> 
  <p>FAITH evades the SNIPER TEAM, exits the STORM DRAIN and finds JACKNIFE on a ROOFTOP.</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE</p> 
  <p>Hello Faitheeeeeee. I’m the smarmiest douchebag you’ve ever met. 
Every line I utter will test your resolve to not shove me off this 
ledge.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>What do you know about Pope’s murder?</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE</p> 
  <p>Oh no, it’s not that easy. First you have to chase me around for no
 particular reason. But don’t worry, I’ll happily wait around if you 
fuck up anywhere.</p> 
  <p>She DOES, FOR FUCK’S SAKE.</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE</p> 
  <p>Now I’ll point you in the direction of the next arbitrary plot 
point. Pope’s head of security was involved in his murder. He calls 
himself Ropeburn.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Rather than question where you got that information, I will blindly
 follow up on it. But first there’s someone else I need to go talk to.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC PARKING GARAGE</p> 
  <p>FAITH sneaks up on LIEUTENANT MILLER.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Lieutenant Miller?</p> 
  <p>LIEUTENANT MILLER</p> 
  <p>(draws sidearm)</p> 
  <p>Bwuaah! Yes, I’m in the habit of pulling my weapon when someone simply calls out my name. Shot three secretaries that way.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Kate said you could be trusted, even though you’re a cop and I despise everything you stand for.</p> 
  <p>LIEUTENANT MILLER</p> 
  <p>Okay, I get that the government is supposed to be evil, but all we have to go on is your incessant whinging.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Let’s keep the opinions about the government to those who are 
opposed to it, shall we? Will you help me by keeping your true 
allegiance entirely ambiguous until the very end of the game?</p> 
  <p>LIEUTENANT MILLER</p> 
  <p>Maybe I will, maybe I won’t!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Excellent. Now could you look over at that disturbance for a 
second? I’d like to employ Batman’s trick of simply vanishing into thin 
air.</p> 
  <p>(disappears)</p> 
  <p>LIEUTENANT MILLER</p> 
  <p>Holy sudden disappearance!</p> 
  <p>EXT. GENERIC OFFICE BUILDING</p> 
  <p>FAITH goes to find ROPEBURN and sees him meeting with MILLER.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Miller! His allegiance is so ambiguous right now!</p> 
  <p>MILLER leaves. FAITH is then attacked by ROPEBURN, who throws her 
off a roof FIFTEEN FUCKING TIMES before she finally manages to FIGHT HIM
 OFF.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Why did you set up Kate? Did you kill Pope? Why were you meeting with Miller? Is any of this still making sense?</p> 
  <p>ROPEBURN</p> 
  <p>Look, we’re only halfway through the game, so obviously I was taking orders from someone higher up.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Give me a plot point, you bastard!</p> 
  <p>ROPEBURN</p> 
  <p>Fine. I’m meeting Pope’s killer tomorrow, even though it makes absolutely no sense for me to do that.</p> 
  <p>ROPEBURN is then SHOT by a MYSTERIOUS SNIPER.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Since you’ve completed your objective for this level, the police has arrived to chase you. Get down into that subway station!</p> 
  <p>FAITH escapes by riding the top of a SUBWAY TRAIN. She is forced to DODGE RAILWAY SIGNALS.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Why does being hit by one of these signals have no more effect on 
me than when I stub my toe? These are the things that lobbed off Dennis 
Hopper’s head in Speed.</p> 
  <p>The POLICE then tries to get FAITH by rerouting other SUBWAY TRAINS to CRUSH her.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Aha, maybe this will finally wake up these sheeple! Because if 
citizens won’t band together over a totalitarian surveillance society, 
they definitely will over a single subway train that’s even slightly 
late!</p> 
  <p>EXT. GENERIC CUTSCENE</p> 
  <p>FAITH and CELESTE are sitting right in front of MERCURY’S HIDEOUT 
in a CITY that’s been repeatedly established as having CAMERAS 
EVERYWHERE.</p> 
  <p>CELESTE</p> 
  <p>You know, even though we’re BFFs, I don’t know anything about your past.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Oh right, I forgot that most of my character development has been relegated to a tie-in comic book.</p> 
  <p>CELESTE</p> 
  <p>Again? Just bottomline it for me.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>My mom was killed during the protest riots. That left my dad bitter
 and resentful, so I left and met Mercury, who trained me to be a 
runner.</p> 
  <p>CELESTE</p> 
  <p>Wait, your response to your mother’s death was abandoning your younger sister? What a dick move.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>So I guess it’s my fault for making her a constant damsel in distress. Whelp, time to go meet Pope’s killer.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC SHOPPING MALL</p> 
  <p>FAITH heads inside the NEW EDEN MALL, where the SAME FIVE STORES keep repeating. This indicates that THE FUTURE IS STARBUCKS.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I can see Pope’s killer! Wait, I’ve reached my objective way too early --</p> 
  <p>(beat)</p> 
  <p>IT’S A TRAP!</p> 
  <p>The POLICE arrives and starts SHOOTING. FAITH runs through the MALL while an ATTACK HELICOPTER fires at her through the GLASS.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Whoa, isn’t this a little drastic? The only way the government 
could be any more totalitarian now is if it started calling itself that.</p> 
  <p>HELICOPTER PILOT</p> 
  <p>Good thing the government has mandated that all streets must be 
empty, or I’d have to worry about raining deadly glass on pedestrians!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>And even so, as I’ve repeatedly demonstrated, glass is completely harmless around here.</p> 
  <p>Eventually, FAITH escapes.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Maybe Jacknife can help, Faith.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>There’s no way I’m chasing that douchebag across a shitload of rooftops again. I’ll just find him in a cutscene.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC CUTSCENE</p> 
  <p>FAITH corners JACKNIFE.</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE</p> 
  <p>What happened?</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>A bad case of the blues. And yes, we call them that so we can make that joke.</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE</p> 
  <p>Out of plot points again, eh? Well, allow me to introduce the next one in a needlessly roundabout way.</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE walks past a SIGN advertising PIRANDELLO/KRUGER, a PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>A PMC? If any media product from the last decade can be believed, they must be horrifyingly evil.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC FACILITY</p> 
  <p>FAITH enters PIRANDELLO/KRUGER and runs up to an ARMED GUARD.</p> 
  <p>GUARD</p> 
  <p>You’ve gotten close to me! I obviously can’t shoot you in the face now, so I’ll resort to hitting you with my gun.</p> 
  <p>FAITH knocks out the GUARD by PUMMELLING his BODY ARMOUR with her TINY, TINY FISTS.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Why is every building I enter populated only by armed guards? 
There’s not even any maintenance workers here, even though pretty much 
everything is still under construction.</p> 
  <p>In the centre of the FACILITY, FAITH accesses a COMPUTER and sees LIVE VIDEO FOOTAGE of POPE’S KILLER at a SHIPYARD.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>There he is! Wait a second, there’s more than one plot point here.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>What do you got?</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Looks like Pirandello/Kruger was part of the plan to set up Kate! 
They want to discredit the police force and take over the city’s 
security responsibilities! They’re coming after us runners by training 
their forces to be just like us!</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>What, reckless and bordering on suicidal?</p> 
  <p>FAITH then runs into some RUNNER COPS, whom she OUTRUNS easily because all they do is DANCE AROUND LIKE IDIOTS.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I’m going to that shipyard. I have absolutely no reason to assume 
that Pope’s killer will move from the spot where I just saw him.</p> 
  <p>EXT. GENERIC SHIPYARD</p> 
  <p>While waiting for the level to load, FAITH sees herself performing TOTALLY BADASS MOVES that she can’t ever do.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>You can get on the ship by sneaking into that utterly unguarded truck down there.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Man, for all the effort the government puts into cracking down on 
subversive elements, there’s a frightening lack of security around here.</p> 
  <p>FAITH makes it aboard the SHIP and then has to get past UNAVOIDABLE
 ARMED GUARDS through TIGHT CORRIDORS, completely defeating the purpose 
of a FREE RUNNING GAME.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Find a way out of there, Faith. Reinforcements are on the way.</p> 
  <p>(beat)</p> 
  <p>Hurry, Faith! You’ve got incoming guards!</p> 
  <p>(beat)</p> 
  <p>GET OUT OF THERE, FAITH! THEY’RE ALMOST ON YOU!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I can see the way out, for fuck’s sake! I just keep screwing up this one goddamn jump to get to it!</p> 
  <p>Eventually, FAITH reaches the UPPER DECK, where she finds and confronts POPE’S KILLER. It turns out to be CELESTE OMG LIKE WTF.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Celeste? Why did you do this?</p> 
  <p>CELESTE</p> 
  <p>I don’t want to just survive, I want to live, Faith! WON’T YOU LET ME LIVE? WON’T YOU PLEASE?</p> 
  <p>A platoon of GUARDS arrives. They start SHOOTING and manage to hit ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. CELESTE escapes FOREVER.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Faith, your sister’s been found guilty of Pope’s murder. I suggest 
you ambush the prison convoy and break her out in order to make her seem
 more guilty.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC CONSTRUCTION SITE</p> 
  <p>FAITH approaches a BUILDING that overlooks the CONVOY’S ROUTE.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Work your way to the top floor, Faith. The convoy’s been instructed to wait until you’re there.</p> 
  <p>She takes FUCKING FOREVER to get to the TOP FLOOR. Once there, she arms a SNIPER RIFLE.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Here comes the convoy now. Put a round in the van’s engine block, 
Faith. That should crash it horribly and maximise the risk of your 
sister being killed.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Of course, because I am clearly a crack shot with a heavy sniper rifle.</p> 
  <p>FAITH snipes the VAN and it CRASHES HORRIBLY.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>Get to her, Faith! Hurry!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Relax, I’ve got plenty of time. Remember how long it took for the 
police to get to Kate when she actually called them? I don’t even have 
to worry about any bystanders, since there aren’t any.</p> 
  <p>FAITH casually saunters down to STREET LEVEL while fighting ARMED GUARDS. She reaches KATE.</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Faith, why did you do all this?</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>You’re my sister.</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>But this got the entire police force on your back, not to mention --</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>YOU’RE MY SISTER! Now let’s split up for no apparent reason.</p> 
  <p>FAITH sends KATE to MERCURY’S HIDEOUT.</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC CUTSCENE</p> 
  <p>When FAITH arrives, she finds MERCURY’S HIDEOUT has been DESTROYED.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I’m almost positive this didn’t happen because I sent a recently escaped high-profile fugitive here.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY</p> 
  <p>They took Kate to the Shard, the mayor’s place. Oh, and I’m dying. 
My facial expression is supposed to be mournful, but it’s not really 
coming across in this art style.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>I know, I have the same problem.</p> 
  <p>MERCURY DIES.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>oh no you are dead</p> 
  <p>INT. GENERIC EVIL HEADQUARTERS</p> 
  <p>FAITH enters the SHARD and is captured by LIEUTENANT MILLER and TWO GUARDS. MILLER suddenly SHOOTS THEM.</p> 
  <p>LIEUTENANT MILLER</p> 
  <p>Relax, they weren’t cops, their texture job is slightly different. They’re from Pirandello/Kruger.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Then why were they still taking orders from you? What are you even 
doing here? And why were you meeting with Ropeburn earlier when you knew
 he was the one who set up Kate?</p> 
  <p>LIEUTENANT MILLER</p> 
  <p>There’s no time to explain, more guards are coming. Run, Faith!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>We’re the only ones here.</p> 
  <p>LIEUTENANT MILLER</p> 
  <p>RUUUUUN!</p> 
  <p>In the next room, there is a LATIN MOTTO everywhere, which makes 
the developers LOOK SMART. FAITH heads for the ROOF and finds JACKNIFE 
holding KATE at gunpoint.</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Jacknife! So it was you all along!</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE</p> 
  <p>Yes, I was randomly selected from the pool of available characters to be the traitor, bwa ha ha!</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>To be fair, there really wasn’t anyone else left at this point.</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE takes KATE onto a HELICOPTER.</p> 
  <p>JACKNIFE</p> 
  <p>You can’t keep living on the edge, Faith. Sooner or later you have 
to jump! Preferably without kicking me out of this helicopter, though! 
Because that would totally suck for me!</p> 
  <p>FAITH kicks JACKNIFE out of the HELICOPTER and saves KATE.</p> 
  <p>KATE CONNORS</p> 
  <p>So now the rest of the building’s security is probably converging on this rooftop. How will we get out of here?</p> 
  <p>FAITH CONNORS</p> 
  <p>Maybe if we just stand here and contemplate for a while, the screen
 will fade to white and our escape will be mentioned in an epilogue.</p> 
  <p>Unsatisfyingly, this HAPPENS.</p>
