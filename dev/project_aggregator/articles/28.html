review</h1><div><div></div></div></div>

<p>I don't think it's exaggerating to say I didn't expect Mirror's Edge
Catalyst would happen.</p>

<p>Mirror's Edge was one of 2008's blackest sheep, a first-person game
that discouraged shooting starring an Asian woman who performed
acrobatic maneuvers through a neon primary-colored future police state
as she delivered packages.</p>

<p>I'll give you a second to take all that in.</p>

<p>It was a deeply divisive game, one that arguably served better as a
proof of concept for cool ideas than as something for the masses, full
of serious flaws that often dragged it down. It also had fierce
defenders, and though they were unable to make Mirror's Edge anything
more than a middling sales disappointment, they kept hope alive that
maybe, someday, developer DICE would be able to step away from the house
it built with the Battlefield series to revisit Faith Connor's
parkour-driven adventure.</p>

<p>Six years later, publisher Electronic Arts shocked those fans by announcing Mirror's Edge Catalyst, a "reimagining"/reboot of the series starring Faith in an open world. Eight years later, it's finally here. And while DICE hasn't quite managed to overcome all of the problems that Mirror's Edge's head-down charge forward often collided with, it turns out an open world is a pretty good space to allow the series to grow.

<p>That isn't really why I signed up, though. <i>Catalyst</i>'s setting 
is a more successful character than most of its human players, and its 
visual language remains stark and brightly colorful in direct 
contradiction of every other triple-A game out there. But it's the play 
that drew me into the original game, and it's here where <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i> has the most to say.</p>
<p>The parkour gameplay from the original game makes a return mostly 
unaltered in form and spirit, though it does feel blessedly smoother and
 marginally more forgiving in <i>Catalyst</i>. The big change is one of venue. Where <i>Mirror's Edge</i> was a linear game, a set of levels to go through accompanied by some time trials, <i>Catalyst</i>
 is, ostensibly, a world. The City of Glass is a place where Faith is 
searching both for answers and a way to pay her old debts, and she can 
take jobs and side missions to do them both.</p>

<div>  <div>
      
        <div><img alt="mirror's edge review screen 2" src="28_files/99f0a752-33b4-45e9-9b07-9c4b4d9e1fce.gif" name="99f0a752-33b4-45e9-9b07-9c4b4d9e1fce" class="en-media" width="1" height="1"></div>
              
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is a great conceit for Faith as a gray-market messenger 
operating outside of the corporate-sanctioned laws of her world, and it 
opens up <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i> in a way that the original game could never manage with its more finite spaces. In <i>Mirror's Edge</i>, you might spend 20 or even 30 seconds at a clip free-running along walls and across gaps. In <i>Catalyst</i>,
 you'll spend multiple minutes getting to missions and completing side 
activities, and even levels that are separated from the main game world 
are considerably larger than anything in the original.</p>
<p>This allows for a lot more of what made <i>Mirror's Edge</i> great in
 the first place, though it's not without some strange concessions to 
generic, open-world game design ideas that trip things up here and 
there. For example, some incredibly important basic parkour abilities 
are locked behind an upgrade tree — namely, the 180-degree turn, an 
ability that is literally required to complete the game, as well as the 
double wall-run, which, while not required, is profoundly helpful.</p>
<p>Once you have those things, <i>Catalyst</i> does very well at 
providing a world full of environments and objects to style off of. It's
 a game whose best reward is playing it, where fast travel is the road 
less taken, because getting there is not half the fun — it's most of it.
 When DICE's level design and mechanics are working, which is a pretty 
good amount of the time, <i>Catalyst</i> is a singular open-world experience. No one moves like Faith — there's a simultaneous flow and heft to everything she does.</p>
<p>This isn't new; it was all in place in <i>Mirror's Edge</i> (the 
first), but it is considerably refined here, and lots of small details 
make Faith feel more rooted in her environment. My favorite is rocketing
 across gaps, and, just before making a life-saving roll upon impact, 
seeing my shadow cast on the ground, growing larger. Largely due to 
much-improved tech, Faith is reflected in much of the world as she 
reacts in it. These visual cues signal a grace that serves as a stronger
 glue this time around, and more effectively made me feel like I was 
doing all of the amazing shit that <i>Catalyst</i> encourages you do.</p>
<p>That is, when it's not busy getting in its own way.</p>

<div>  <div>
      
        <div><img alt="mirror's edge review screen 3" src="28_files/99f0a752-33b4-45e9-9b07-9c4b4d9e1fce.gif" name="99f0a752-33b4-45e9-9b07-9c4b4d9e1fce" class="en-media" width="1" height="1"></div>
              
  </div>
</div>

<p>Take the time trial mechanics, for example. <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i>
 offers a multiplayer-oriented ghost function that will allow your 
friends to see your runs and compete against them, which is great! It's a
 racing game conceit that translates to <i>Catalyst</i> perfectly. But 
it translates almost too well, because time trials support all the speed
 and traversal upgrades you can unlock as you progress — meaning that 
until you and your friends all have your skill trees maxed out, 
perfecting your times on these courses is pointless. It's like racing a 
crappy car against a tuned machine.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i> can display a strange lack 
of confidence in its best self, and the game buries some of its coolest 
elements. My favorite sections of the game are the grid node puzzles, 
which are the purest platforming brain teasers the game has to offer. In
 a stroke of genius, there are two levels of challenge in these 
sections. Basic traversal is one — Faith must find a way to a platform 
through multiple levels of the very complicated catwalks and geometry of
 a server room not designed for human egress. This is Mirror's Edge 101 
stuff, but it never stopped feeling cool.</p>
<p>But there's a second, optional mechanic in play in grid node 
sections, as security lasers are strategically placed throughout each 
environment. Crossing a beam sets off a security alert, which is 
generally not a thing you should be doing, though you won't instantly 
fail for screwing up. If you're like me, however, you will feel pretty 
badass threading jumps and slides and wall-runs just so, like some kind 
of parkour cat burglar.</p>
<q>Mirror's Edge Catalyst can display a strange lack of confidence in its best self</q>
<p>Only one of these missions is critical to finishing the game. The 
rest are optional tasks that open up fast travel options throughout 
Glass. And I'll be honest: This seems like a colossal waste. I'd have 
much rather gone through more and more intricate future heists than have
 had to beat up another room full of security forces using combat 
mechanics that still aren't very fun.</p>
<p>The City of Glass' security forces are usually nonlethally armed. 
Security officers with guns have advanced weapons that can only be used 
by their owner. Now let that breath out, because DICE still falls prey 
to far too frequent combat encounters that try to squeeze more out of <i>Catalyst</i>'s
 fighting system than it's really capable of. Faith's martial arts 
prowess is absent the fluidity and grace of her high-speed navigation 
through the environment, and it feels frustratingly clunky by 
comparison.</p>
<p>I didn't particularly enjoy the combat in <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i>,
 but there is at least a sense of satisfaction to the crunch of a 
roundhouse kick connecting with the helmet of a K-Sec officer. I felt a 
grim kind of accomplishment at beating the more elite troops every now 
and again.</p>
  <div>
      
        <div><img alt="mirror's edge catalyst review screen 1" src="28_files/99f0a752-33b4-45e9-9b07-9c4b4d9e1fce.gif" name="99f0a752-33b4-45e9-9b07-9c4b4d9e1fce" class="en-media" width="1" height="1"></div>
              
  </div>

<p>But K-Sec and fistfights seem to be <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i>'s 
crutch when it can't think of anything else to do. Too many levels end 
with boring physical encounters; the last quarter of the game especially
 suffers from this, falling prey to standard action game conventions. 
Enemies that served as bosses appear in regular groups of enemies, and 
then there are two heavies. "Screw it," I imagine someone said — "let's 
just literally have a slapstick moment where Faith comes around a 
corner, and there are 15 dudes having some kind of team-building meeting
 in an executive apartment, and Faith is waiting for an elevator anyway,
 so ..."</p>
<p>You can fill in the ellipses with your fists. This is actually a 
thing that happens. There are minor moments of wave-based enemy survival
 in <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i>, which seems about as far from the spirit of the rest of the game as anything I can imagine, shy a rocket launcher boss fight.</p>
<p>But this is also set against the backdrop of platforming that 
increasingly feels like a cheap death trap, rather than the smart 
problems to be solved elsewhere. Or, as often, <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i>
 relies too much on standing in just the right place and tapping the MAG
 rope button to zip up to where you need to be. The last quarter of the 
game is a bad ribbon to tie on top of an otherwise mostly cool spin on 
the ideas of the original.</p>

  <h4>Wrap Up:</h4>
  <blockquote>An open world gives Mirror's Edge Catalyst room to grow</blockquote>
  <p>
    <p class="large">But once the story is done, <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i> still has all the stuff left to do that makes it unique. This is a review-unique scenario — I have to play the critical path, and most people will never finish the game. Instead, I imagine most players will happily bounce from side mission to delivery to grid node and back again, content to do what Mirror's Edge has always been best at: constantly moving forward and up. And once you can focus on that, <i>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</i> is a flawed, but often great breath of something different and exciting in an open-world landscape full of the same old thing.</p>
