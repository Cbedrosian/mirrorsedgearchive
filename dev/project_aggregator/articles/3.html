<em>This is the latest in the series of articles about the art technology of games, in collaboration with the particularly handsome <a href="http://deadendthrills.com/" target="_blank">Dead End Thrills</a>.</em><p></p>
<p>Robert Briscoe is obviously not the only great environment artist in 
games, and it’s a bit weird to say he has a singular portfolio after 
working on just two titles. What makes it a lot easier is if you think 
in terms of levels: The Shard, Jacknife, Reflex, Velocity (from Mirrors 
Edge and its DLC); The Lighthouse, The Cave, The Beacon (from Dear 
Esther). All masterpieces up there with BioShock’s Welcome To Rapture, 
Half-Life 2’s Point Insertion and – quick, think of something slightly 
less distinguished to prove worldliness – that level in Robocod made out
 of Penguin bars.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken at length to Rob before <a href="http://www.edge-online.com/features/mirrors-edge-building-the-impossible/" target="_blank">about Mirror’s Edge</a>,
 but never about the more dramatic moments of his career: the move from 
triple-A to indie after just one game, and how obsessiveness helped 
bring him to burnout on one and a near breakdown on the other. So here 
goes, for the benefit of other bright idealists looking to dodge the 
bullets, or for anyone just looking for some juicy old Mirror’s Edge 2 
goss. *tuts*</p>
<div><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/DET/briscoe/rob05.jpg" target="_blank"><div><img src="3_files/e830ccaf-849a-4219-a431-8fe0da711930.jpg" name="e830ccaf-849a-4219-a431-8fe0da711930" class="en-media" width="576" height="576"></div></a><p><strong>Briscoe:</strong> Actino Rise, one of my favourite Mirror’s Edge DLC levels for its sheer simplicity and beauty.</p></div>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> Why did you leave DICE?</p>
<p><strong>Rob Briscoe:</strong> When you’re working on a project like 
Mirror’s Edge, there are certain constraints that are put upon you, not 
necessarily by the creatives involved but by management and by time. 
You’re still creative while you’re working but you <em>have to get shit done</em>, and it’s during that time that you see little windows of opportunity.</p>
<p>One of the most defining things about Mirror’s Edge for me was that 
there was a certain element of environmental storytelling going on: the 
janitor and his rat, and little bits and pieces we just left around. 
There were loads. For us as environment artists it became a game in 
itself: who could stick their own side-stories in there to make people 
stop and take in the environment?</p>
<p>After we’d done the DLC the figures had come back, and EA were like, 
‘Nah, this isn’t profitable, it isn’t viable, we’re cutting it off.’ I 
actually left before Mirror’s Edge 2 was cancelled the first time.</p>
<p>Mirror’s Edge was a brilliant project for me, I learned so much and 
had so many ideas from it. But there’s a point where, when it comes to 
sequels, you feel like you’re not really evolving. It’s doing the same 
thing slightly differently, and that, along with the burnout, was the 
end point for me. There were no other projects internally I was 
interested in. I’ve gotta say I was quite disillusioned at the end.</p>
<p>Working with some of the artists on the team and the team itself was 
all brilliant. I started at DICE and barely knew anything; I’d done 
level design for about five or six years beforehand, working in Hammer 
and Radiant and stuff, and had only just gotten into doing UV mapping. 
When I finished it was just amazing. But the pressure that was put on 
you as an artist takes the creative enjoyment away and makes it into 
more of a sausage factory.</p>
<p>I have pretty high standards in my work. One of my things is that if 
it’s not up to a level I’m happy with, it’s not something I can leave 
alone, it’s something I obsess about. A lot of the late nights I did 
were just me getting things up to a level I was satisfied with. That’s 
how it went for a lot of the team.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/DET/briscoe/rob06.jpg" target="_blank"><div><img src="3_files/eb46d57a-f6f2-403d-a89c-a8b7b8114dc0.jpg" name="eb46d57a-f6f2-403d-a89c-a8b7b8114dc0" class="en-media" width="576" height="576"></div></a><p><strong>Briscoe:</strong>
 The Stormdrains were built for a creative escape from the usual 
high-rises and rooftops found in the rest of the game, while still 
maintaining the verticality that was so important to the gameplay.</p></div>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> How was Mirror’s Edge 2 shaping up?</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> There was R&amp;D going on when I left, and at 
that point it was looking quite interesting. It was an opportunity to 
smooth out all the issues we’d had along the way and implement the ideas
 we didn’t have time to do.</p>
<p>We had some amazing concept art. Johannes [Söderqvist, art director 
on the first game and its original sequel] came up with a bunch of 
concepts with Pierre Hanna, who’s this amazing concept artist who did 
all the paintings in the first game. They were taking the style of the 
first game and expanding it, making it look different while still 
keeping the aesthetic. So you had this really clean look that was like 
Mirror’s Edge inverted: if you just took a picture of Mirror’s Edge and 
inverted it, it was kind of like that. And it looked super cool, kind of
 like a noir style. That wasn’t the whole game, obviously, just a way of
 expanding the art in a new direction. So I’m really hoping that at some
 point they show something similar.</p>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> You’re referring to the new Mirror’s Edge 2, 
which had a very weird announcement trailer that didn’t really suggest 
they’d fixed anything. It had no message for the fans who’d petitioned 
it into being.</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> I gotta say I still don’t understand why it’s a 
reboot. I know the story was a bit shit in the first one, but there was 
still so much room to continue on from there, take the world that was 
built and keep building on it. But what did they mean? Reboot? There’s 
that bit in the trailer where it’s action and you’re thinking, ‘Shit, 
what is their plan? Are they making it into some kind of 
God-Of-War-in-firstperson beat ’em up?’ Which is obviously the complete 
opposite of what we were going for in the first Mirror’s Edge.</p>
<p>The trailer is very almost-Battlefield – very colour-graded and 
cinematic, shall we say? The original was very stylised, fresh and 
different. One of my pet gripes is that every game today wants to look 
like it’s shot through Michael Bay’s sunglasses or JJ Abrams’ asshole. 
One of the things that defines Mirror’s Edge is that it wasn’t any of 
those things. It wasn’t set through a camera lens but someone’s eyes. 
When I saw the colour-grading on that trailer– I don’t know if you saw 
on Twitter, but someone posted to me a colour-corrected version and I 
RT’d that because, boom, they’d nailed it.</p>
<p>There are some really good guys I knew on that team, some from Grin, a
 couple from Starbreeze. They’re really good artists. But I don’t think 
Johannes is working on that any more, I’m not sure. So whether the art 
direction is going to stick with the original or be rebooted, I don’t 
know. But it’s one of those things where it’s like: they’re messing with
 my baby.</p>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> I wonder if they’ll spare it the dirty camera lens effect.</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> That’s a last-gen thing where they try and cover
 up limitations in the graphics with shitloads of post-processing, and 
you end up with a situation where someone’s got glaucoma. It’s just 
completely unrealistic and ruins what good art there is. Did you play 
Syndicate? From an art point of view, that just felt like instead of 
trying to work on the art they just smeared all this bloom and lens 
flare all over it to compensate. It just makes me cringe so hard when I 
see stuff like that.</p>
<div><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/DET/briscoe/rob08.jpg" target="_blank"><div><img src="3_files/80f63a99-0062-4d07-a182-d6463bc88d44.jpg" name="80f63a99-0062-4d07-a182-d6463bc88d44" class="en-media" width="576" height="576"></div></a><p><strong>Briscoe:</strong>
 One of the goals with Dear Esther’s art was to make the island look 
like one big organic sculpture, with rocks, grass and even buildings 
seemingly growing from its surface.</p></div>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> Moving on to Dear Esther, how spontaneous was the remake?</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> The idea of embedded storytelling – the janitor 
and his rat – grew throughout Mirror’s Edge, and when I stumbled upon 
Dear Esther it was the ‘Eureka!’ moment, the perfect outlet. I’d made a 
vow when I stopped working at a defence company that I never wanted to 
model another tank or plane ever again, so I decided I was going to take
 a year out. It wasn’t even a year – I was going to take six months out 
and just chill out and do nothing, and maybe work on this side-project.</p>
<p>I’d spent the last two years in the office and hadn’t had many 
experiences outside of that – hadn’t seen my family, really. The plan 
was that in six months I’d go out and get another job. But working on 
Dear Esther just brought it all into perspective. The creative 
fulfilment you can have from doing something that is entirely yours, 
that you have complete control over, is what really reinvigorated the 
whole thing of being a game artist, of carrying on with games. There’s a
 real contrast there between being paid to do a job and doing something 
you really believe in and love.</p>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> But both have their dangers, right?</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> That’s the other side. Dear Esther was a passion
 project, it was everything. ‘This is an accumulation of everything I’ve
 done as an environment artist.’ The downside is that you lose touch 
with everything else, with what other games and artists are doing. I 
went through a period of, I don’t know, maybe a year or longer without 
playing a single game. And it’s been hard to get out of.</p>
<p>I used to come home from work and play the shit out of a game like 
STALKER, and play it again and again, but until recently I’ve had to 
force myself to sit down and play games. What you can learn from them is
 amazing – very technical things like: How did they build this bush? 
It’s one of those things that’s made me think I need to be around other 
people again. You learn so much when you’re in a team, around other 
people who are better than you.</p>
<p>Another thing is that there was no plan for Dear Esther, there was 
nothing. One of the things I always say if I ever do talks and people 
ask how to become an indie is, first and foremost, that you’ve got to 
make sure you’re financially stable. You’ve got to save and prepare for 
the fact you’ll be isolated and alone. There won’t be outside pressure 
but pressure on yourself. That’s in some ways worse because you’ve put 
an expectation into your mind, and if you fail then it’s not like 
missing a deadline at a big company.</p>

 The caves are a unique break in Dear Esther’s bleak, open environments 
that allowed room to explore a more surreal, organic style that was full
 of metaphors and hidden imagery.</p></div>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> The darkest hour?</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> That would be just before Dear Esther got 
funding from the Indie Fund. We went through a point where we were 
promised all this funding from Dan’s [Pinchbeck, creative designer] 
university, and at this point I had two grand left in the bank to last 
six months. All of the money had just gone into getting the Source 
Engine licence and paying for a coder, getting the audio remastered and 
the music redone. There was nothing for anyone to actually pay 
themselves with. So, it was a case of: ‘Cool, let’s do it. So long as it
 comes out within six months then I’m good to go, I can just about make 
it.’</p>
<p>We’d already been in negotiations with Valve for a Source Engine 
licence for about four months, and it took another four months to get 
that finished. The university was waiting for us to get this licence 
sorted before they could pay it, and when we finally got the licence to 
them they saw a small clause at the bottom. Valve have a non-indemnity 
clause that means that if there’s anything offensive that might cause 
people to sue, you’re completely liable for it – and of course the 
university shit themselves. ‘Someone’s going to sue us because they 
thought we killed their wife’ or something ridiculous. This was four or 
five months <em>after</em> the date where I’d said it needed to be out 
in six, and they turned around and said no, there was no way they were 
funding it now.</p>
<p>The game was almost finished and I just sat down, looked at my finances, and was like: ‘I’m fucked. <em>Absolutely fucked</em>.’
 I was a grand into my overdraft and had about a grand left. Even after 
getting the Source Engine licence I just didn’t think I would make it.</p>
<p>The <em>stupidity</em> of what I’d done, racking up debts… You never 
go into your overdraft because the interest is just ridiculous; get your
 balls cut off, it’s less painful. I was borrowing money off friends and
 family, doing the figures of what it would take to pay everyone off, 
and it was 20,000 sales just to break even*. That’s with no money going 
to myself. ‘Nobody’s going to fucking buy this game, it’s just 
ridiculous.’ I almost had a breakdown and was depressed for the rest of 
the project.</p>
<p>It was just fucking scary. I’d been so passionate about this thing 
and was so determined to get it finished that I’d not really thought 
what the consequences might be if anything went wrong, if we went 
outside of the plan. I see it as a fault in my personality more than 
anything else, this thing where I became so focused I didn’t see the 
consequences.</p>

 One of my earliest experiments with a hand painted art style. The goal 
was to create a watercolour style that had consistent background and 
foreground detail to look like it had been painted straight onto the 
screen with a brush.</p></div>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> Developers in similar circumstances now might 
turn to Early Access for funding. I’m not sure that’s doing their games 
any favours.</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> The problem with Early Access is that you’re 
giving players who are eager to play your game this not-ideal experience
 to take away with them. You can slap ‘beta’ and ‘unfinished’ all over 
it but, at the end of the day, if it’s really buggy and not a good 
experience, people are going to go away thinking: ‘It’s shit. It’s not 
what I expected.’ There’s such a small window if you’re an indie to go 
out there and make your sales. For us it was the first month we had it 
out, and by the end of that we were on drip-feed until the sales. That’s
 when people form an opinion and talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> It’s not like gamers’ attention spans and 
interest levels reset when the game comes out, either. You can tire of a
 game before it’s even out nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> You have about 50 different trailers coming out,
 and it’s not just trailers of the game but live action trailers, 
concept art trailers, documentary trailers… It gets ridiculous. You 
don’t even care any more. It’s like when you see one of those bad movie 
trailers that has the entire story in it, so what’s the point in 
watching the movie? I had that experience with Far Cry 3. I finally got 
to the game itself and, like a lot of people, I just wanted to go out 
and explore, so I buggered off up the map on my own. Then I died and 
ended up six miles back in the other direction. Fuck it, I didn’t want 
to go back. That was it, my attention span was gone.</p>

 All Good Things was created for the Unearthly Competition back in 2009.
 This piece was one of the earliest that experimented with environmental
 story. It depicts the death of a great hero, a Viking warrior on his 
journey to Valhalla.</p></div>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> You did a lot of small experiments in Unreal and Unity after Dear Esther. Were you in limbo?</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> For the last year I’ve been trying to explore 
different avenues of art, going outside of my usual photorealistic type 
of thing, doing some hand-drawn stuff. The Ghibli tests were from when I
 saw a bit of Ni No Kuni and thought, ‘Yeah, that’s really good but it 
hasn’t quite got that watercolour look.’ So I went off looking at that, 
trying to learn new skills and improve myself. But I went through a 
period of about a year, I’d say, from the moment the Mac port [of Dear 
Esther] finished, where it was like, ‘Right, what the fuck do I do now?’
 One of the first things I did was do nothing, I just turned my computer
 off. Needless to say that didn’t last.</p>
<p>It’s weird giving something like that up. It’s like a habit, like quitting smoking. You have a hole that you need to fill.</p>
<p>One of the first things I did was download UDK and decide to just 
start making shit in that. I spent about three or four months just 
making this shitty little hill. I was just trying to figure out how all 
the terrain materials work and I got completely obsessed. ‘That’s too 
many shader instructions, I have to get that down.’ Three months later: 
‘I’ve done <em>fuck all</em>. I designed a whole level in Dear Esther in that time.’ So I carried on doing that for another six months.</p>
<p>It got to the point where I just sat down and said: ‘Right, what are 
my goals? I need an idea for a game. I need to sit down with a piece of 
paper.’ That was probably one of the most difficult things I’d ever 
done, I just don’t have the attention span.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing I had no choice other than Source at the start of 
Dear Esther because that would have been a nightmare. One of the things 
that helped me a lot was that I just couldn’t do anything with that 
engine. I couldn’t go in and make my own shaders, I had to go through a 
coder to do anything. It’s almost like asking your mum, and sometimes 
they say no. Going over to UDK you’ve got <em>everything</em>. ‘Where do
 I start? I’m just going to make a massive shader that looks and 
functions just like a real-life neutron.’ Something stupid like that is 
basically what I did for those six months.</p>

 The Willows was an abandoned survival-horror project from 2008, set in 
remote woodland. The art and location was a heavy mix of Stalker and 
early Alan Wake stuff.</p></div>
<p><strong>DET:</strong> What was The Willows?</p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> That was the project I was going to do before 
Dear Esther came along, just something I’d been tweaking and playing 
with for a year or so while I was at DICE. It was an excuse to build a 
forest environment where you had to explore, but it was a compromise 
between that and gameplay. The idea was that you were a writer who’d 
stranded himself on an island in this wooded resort, and about six 
months later you wake up one night aaand… there’s a zombie!</p>
<p>You go outside and find out the forest’s been overrun, and there’s 
this boat that’s supposed to come each day that’s been gone for a couple
 of weeks. You’ve got to scavenge bits and pieces to build a boat engine
 and escape. It was kind of time-based where there’d be more and more 
zombies spawning over time, and the more you’d kill, the more would 
spawn. They were the slow Dawn Of The Dead type zombies. I didn’t really
 want the zombies in there at all but there wasn’t a game without it. 
Then Left 4 Dead 2 came out and for five years everything was zombies. 
So I put that on the back-burner, but it’s one thing I’ve been reworking
 recently because it’s obviously been proved – and not just with Dear 
Esther – that you don’t have to shoot things to be interesting.</p>

 The Escape is an unfinished piece primarily made to expand upon earlier
 experiments in creating hand-painted environment art. The style is 
heavily influenced by Ghibli movies. The scene shows the secret refuge 
for a young female worker in an industrial coastal town.</p></div>
