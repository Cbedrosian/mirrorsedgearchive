    Star Wars: Battlefront – from the makers of Battlefield
   
   
  <p>GameCentral speaks to the boss&nbsp;of DICE, about Star Wars: 
Battlefront space battles and Mirror’s Edge Catalyst’s lack of gunplay.</p> 
  <p>Being the general manager of Battlefield creator DICE makes Patrick
 Bach a very important man. But we’ve spoken to him a few times over the
 years and have always been impressed by the fact that he’s the opposite
 of what you’d expect, in that he’s very laid-back, soft spoken, and 
engagingly honest.</p> 
  <p>Which was all the more impressive at E3 given that Bach and his 
team at DICE were responsible for two of the show’s biggest games: 
multiplayer shooter Star Wars: Battlefront and first person platformer 
Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. He showed no signs of stress when we met him 
though, and instead we had an enjoyable chat about the numerous 
challenges in making both games.</p> 
  <p>As often happens at E3 the interviews and demos were done the wrong
 way round, so we hadn’t actually played either game when we talked to 
him. But you can find our hands-on impressions for <a shape="rect" href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/17/star-wars-battlefront-hands-on-preview-dice-strike-back-5249339/" target="_blank">Battlefront here</a> and for <a shape="rect" href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/06/18/mirrors-edge-catalyst-hands-on-preview-faith-rewarded-5251227/" target="_blank">Mirror’s Edge here</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>PR guy:</strong> I remember you from that epic <a shape="rect" href="http://metro.co.uk/2014/09/04/battlefield-hardline-interview-i-think-its-an-exciting-idea-4857211/" target="_blank">Steve Papoutsis interview</a>.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Oh yeah, the one for Battlefield Hardline. That was a weird one!</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PR guy:</strong> [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC: [To Bach] <strong>So, did you cry when you watched The Force Awakens trailer?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> No, no, no. I was smiling yes, but we 
[Scandinavians] don’t cry. We don’t laugh. [laughs] No, I saw it at the 
Star Wars Celebration. But I geek out on not only… Star Wars to me is 
not only the saga, it’s the details and the gear and the gadgets and all
 the nitty gritty. So I get sensory overload, like I try to take 
everything in…</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>I was watching the Battlefront gameplay footage, 
looking for any error I could bring you up on – but I didn’t see 
anything. So were you genuinely a fan before all this, when you were a 
kid and growing up?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes, but I wasn’t like, ‘I only care about 
Star Wars’. Star Wars was one of the things I was really, really 
impressed with when I&nbsp;saw it. You think, ‘Oh my god, this is so 
amazing!’ But I’m not trying to pretend I was only into Star Wars. I was
 into many things, but I think Star Wars was probably the sci-fi saga 
that was for me the most appealing.</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> So you weren’t a Trekkie?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> That’s the thing. I loved Star Trek as well, but not in the same way. I think Star Trek is very, very different…</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Well, it was until J. J. Abrams got hold of it.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC:<strong> I ask because I presume you must have been one of the 
first people EA came to when they got the Star Wars licence. Maybe you 
were even involved in acquiring it?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> No, it didn’t come to me first. Because this 
was a big deal for EA, involving many people and studios. When the 
discussion came to the Battlefront part of the IP, it was like: ‘DICE 
should do it!’ But the problem with that is that we were fully booked at
 the time, so you know what happens if you’re fully booked…</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> I do funnily enough, being at E3!</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] So the rational part of your brain 
says, ‘Absolutely no, we can’t do that’. And then your heart kicks in 
and say,’You know what? Absolutely, yes! I don’t know how but we’ll 
figure it out’.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>But do you know where the idea came from to make Battlefront EA’s first Star Wars game? Because from a certain point of view </strong>[chuckles]<strong>
 it does make sense, but using someone else’s old IP is a slightly odd 
way to start. The old games were good but they weren’t great, and they 
were of course clones of Battlefield.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes! It’s a great concept to copy, right?</p>

   </div>
   
    Star Wars: Battlefront – jam their comlinks, centre switch!
   
   
  <p>GC: [laughs] <strong>But for me ground combat is not particularly 
high up on the list of things I think of when I think of Star Wars. 
There were really only two land battles in the films, one of which was 
purposefully unbalanced and the other one the Rebels would’ve lost 
without the ewoks. Which immediately presents some serious problems for a
 game. Was there any dissenting voice that said maybe this isn’t such a 
good idea?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> No one had to convince me, that’s for sure. It
 was more like: here’s an opportunity to make something amazing. Here’s 
an opportunity to make something people have wanted, and they’ve almost 
gotten it, but never properly. So, I think to me the thing that got me 
going with the concept is probably the fact that I’m extremely demanding
 when it comes to opportunity. So, when I think about what the Star Wars
 games should be, in my head there’s a lot of things I think it should 
be. There’s also some things I don’t think it should be, unless you can 
do it all the way.</p> 
  <p>Star Wars is a very complicated IP, because it’s extremely wide. 
It’s everything, right? It’s not only the movies, it’s like… you have 
the three movies, and then you have three other movies, and there’s the 
new movie; then you have the books, and the TV series – the cartoon ones
 that come in very different shapes and forms. So it’s also about focus.
 Pick the Star Wars you want to be and stay true to that. So I think 
that was kind of… at least in my head, and I know the team had a very 
similar mindset on that… we need to do this to quality, because that’s 
what the Star Wars IP deserves.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>You’re right that you could make so many different 
types of games from Star Wars. But Battlefront’s approach was very much 
to throw everything in at once. But you’re not doing that and that 
immediately opens you up to criticism. I’m sure you saw that comparison 
between your game and Battlefront II on the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.eastarwars.com/" target="_blank">cybersquatting website</a>?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes, yes.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>I’m sure you’ll argue they’re being unfair, but can you honestly say they don’t have a point?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> I think in general, if more is the only thing 
you value then I think you are a very specific type of person. I don’t 
think in reality that is true. I think then you could look at so many 
things, like… more food is better than less food. Period, there is no 
discussion on quality of food or what it is or how it’s made or even how
 it’s served. It’s just more food is better. Free-for-all buffets, where
 you can eat all you can for $10, is not the ultimate dinner.</p> 
  <p>So to me, that argument can hold up if you accept the fact that 
enough is what you want, in each dimension. Enough width, enough 
breadth, enough depth. I think Star Wars is an IP where there are more 
than one or two or three, or even four dimensions. It’s like eight 
dimensions! So the question is how do you fill that sphere? Rather than 
just have more in terms of content, or more vehicles, or more… I dunno, 
whatever you claim you want. To us it’s important that whatever we do we
 do it in quality. And I think, hopefully, that is what we’re proving 
here today at E3.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div>
   
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Again you’re right, there are many aspects to why Star 
Wars is popular. But one thing that always frustrates me about the games
 is that they never get the tone quite right. Developers, and I think 
probably nerds in general, of which of course I am one, tend to take 
things very seriously and resent anything that they deem too silly or 
childish. But there’s a sense of fun and playfulness in Star Wars that I
 think many of the games miss. I don’t want to use the word camp, 
because it’s such a misused term, but do you recognise that element of 
the films that I’m alluding to?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes, absolutely. I’m actually happy that you 
bring that up, because that’s yet another dimension where people 
remember it, in a way, because they were young. So, when you are 11 and 
you watch Star Wars it is quite serious. But when you are 35 or 55 it’s a
 bit… let’s call it campy. In certain aspects. But in general it has a 
serious undertone, but there are elements of fun and sometimes almost 
silliness. And I’m not saying we’re aiming to do a silly game, we are 
treating this very seriously, but we are also striving to add that 
flavour that you seem to have picked up on. It’s the fun factor that 
makes Star Wars, Star Wars. That it doesn’t take itself too seriously 
everywhere. Darth Vader wouldn’t pull a joke, but some of the other 
characters might.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>That’s it exactly. The drama is deadly serious, but there’s always more to it than that.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes, yes. So that’s one big part of Star Wars:
 Battlefront, is the playfulness. Make sure that it’s fun, make sure 
there are bits and pieces and elements that are not taking itself too 
seriously, and there are things that we take dead seriously. The whole 
shooting experience needs to be spot on, perfect – there’s no 
discussion. But then you can do things on top which are fun and playful.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>That’s just what I wanted to hear. And this… it’s a bit
 of a boring question but I know it’s one fans feel strongly on – but 
why doesn’t the game have iron sights? Is that partly for the reasons 
we’ve just been talking about?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> The question is often asked in a way where you say one thing and you mean something else.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Personally, I don’t really mind either way.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> You have scopes, there are scopes in the game 
and you can look down scopes. But iron sights are not the same as 
scopes. So there are weapons that have more military behaviours and 
there are guns that are less military.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>How do hardcore shooter fans view the game in general? I doubt that iron sights are their only concern at the moment.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> I think that’s a very interesting question. I 
think some people will see it as a dumbed down shooter because they just
 think that Star Wars is not a serious shooter game. I think when you 
play it, and you see what we have done, you will see that it has the 
depth and the breadth and the detail of a proper shooter. Again, I’m not
 saying DICE is best in the world at what we do, when it comes to 
shooters, but we’re pretty good.</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> You’re not near the bottom.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] I’m only saying that because I want 
people to know that we’re taking this very seriously, and we’re also 
taking the fun factor very seriously. So for us creating a shooter needs
 to be taken seriously, creating Star Wars needs to be taken seriously –
 no matter if it’s the fun or the seriousness of it. But we are trying 
to take all of these things into account when we create this game.</p> 
  <p>And that’s what makes it hard, because you still need to stay true 
to the authenticity of Star Wars, while also going deep into what it 
means to be a shooter. Some people are joking about the authenticity of 
the game because the Stormtroopers are actually hitting stuff… [laughs] </p>

    Star Wars: Battlefront – there are spaceships… but no space
   
   
  <p>GC: <strong>So, you have an out for this next question, because I hope the answer is one you can’t give me.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC: <strong>But why no space combat? Because, you know, it is Star 
Wars – not Ground Wars. Hopefully the reason is because you’re making a 
new X-Wing or TIE Fighter game and you’re going to admit that fact as an
 exclusive right now.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC: <strong>Or are you going to tell me that’s going to be added in later?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> The one answer, and there are several, is if 
you look at what we’re showing here you can see that there’s interaction
 between ground and air vehicles, and that is what creates a fun battle 
on the ground. We come from Battlefield, where this is key, and for 
Battlefront that was also key: to have everyone play against each other,
 no matter what role you have. And removing that, taking people into 
space, is only focusing on one role. So to do that you would narrow down
 the focus of who the game is for.</p> 
  <p>Because that’s a very unique experience that is standalone, for 
that type of player. I’m not saying that that’s a counter to, ‘But I 
still want it!’ but what we want to do now, and this is a long-term 
commitment for us, is to get the core of the Battlefront experience 
right – and focus down on what makes it cool to play together with other
 people. Because again it’s a multiplayer-focused shooter and 
multiplayer to us means multiple personalities playing together.</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> I’m sure you saw that leaked <a shape="rect" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WeX41WfOsY" target="_blank">pre-alpha footage</a> of Free Radical’s Battlefront III.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>With the spaceship taking off from the ground and then flying into space, almost like No Man’s Sky.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> We could probably build that game, but it’s not this game. It’s a very different game.</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> If you did make it would you call it Battlefront?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Not that exact experience. If you take No Man’s Sky and put Star Wars: Battlefront on it, it’s not Star Wars: Battlefront.</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> I only mention No Man’s Sky as an example of the tech.</strong></p>

    Patrick Bach – a generally busy manager
   
   
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> I know, I know. But that fantasy that you 
describe to me, I think that’s very interesting – that’s definitely a 
game – but it’s not this game. Of course people shoot me down and say, 
‘Yes, but I want it to be’. But my responsibility, and the team’s 
responsibility, is to make sure that when people play together they’re 
actually playing… together. It’s not pilot versus pilot, because that’s 
another game. Again, I’m not saying we would never do it. But for this 
game it’s not the focus.</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> I don’t know who would make a new X-Wing game nowadays 
or what it would be like, because those were very complicated games 
originally. But I think DICE could probably take a good crack at it.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> We’re decently competent, yes. [laughs] We could probably make a game like that.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Did you use to like them, back in the day?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes… although I see flaws in them. [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC: <strong>You heretic! What flaws?!</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] Again, I think my problem with games 
sometimes, depending on what the games are, is that they sometimes miss 
their audience and they are maybe sometimes too niche. My problem with 
niche games is when they claim they are not niche.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>For me, on the PC, that was just the perfect Star Wars game. It was everything I wanted.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yeah, and that’s my point: if that’s what you 
want it’s a brilliant game. But if you want Star Wars, no. That’s not 
Star Wars for me. Star Wars for me is fighting the AT-ATs on Hoth, 
flying snowspeeders, or shooting that weapon or doing this or that. And 
then you’re not getting that… so if you had that game there would be 
another part of Star Wars that you wouldn’t get. There’s always 
something you won’t get.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>I suppose I should be happy it happened once.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> But that’s it. I respect that, but that’s the burden of Star Wars. Because there’s always another experience…</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> EA must feel awful about it. All these guaranteed hits they’re forced to make huge amounts of money from.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>All:</strong> [laughs] </p>
  <p></p>
  <div>
   
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Right, sorry. We must get onto Mirror’s Edge. The 
original, I thought, was an excellent idea, with amazing art design, but
 the level design often didn’t support the mechanics. There was a real 
mismatch there. Would you agree in the end that it was a great idea but 
not a great game?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> I think you’ve answered the question! [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC: <strong>You could’ve argued the game was perfect!</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> No, no. I think you’re to the point, 100 per 
cent correct, that the promise of the game was amazing but the delivery 
of that emotion did not come through. So you have the promise of Faith, 
which did not really come through to its full potential because of some 
problems with the storytelling, some problems with how it was told, 
etc., etc. The movement, great potential – didn’t come through because 
the city was limited and it was also quite hard. A lot of people quit 
before they got passed the tutorial, because they kept dying.</p> 
  <p>So, to your point, everyone seems to love the concept of Mirror’s 
Edge. Not everyone loves the result. [laughs] So we actually went back 
and did an analysis, and I had someone else in here who asked, ‘So 
you’re keeping Faith as a non-male non-Caucasian badass gunslinger’?</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Gunslinger?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yeah, because you could argue that all great games have male Caucasian, muscley gunslinger.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Oh right, yeah. The bald space marine cliché.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Because when we looked at the reasons why 
Mirror’s Edge didn’t work the promise of it wasn’t the problem, everyone
 loves the promise, it was the realisation of the promise that was the 
problem. And the traversal of the city, that you wanted to be open and 
free, was not there.</p> 
  <p>The character didn’t come through, all the way. You saw the picture
 of her and you saw something that you wanted to know more about, but we
 didn’t really tell you all of the things. So we went back and created 
the origin story, we went back to the drawing board and had a completely
 new, fresh take on it – which then changed everything, but it feels the
 same when it comes to the emotions.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>What I liked best about your conference presentation 
was the decision to have no gunplay at all. It would’ve been easy to 
imagine you making it more of a straight shooter, to attract a bigger 
audience.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yeah, if you’re just a box-ticking man. There’s no guns. She won’t use a gun. She’ll disarm people but she won’t pick it up.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>I assumed&nbsp;you were implying she doesn’t like using them.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> No, she won’t. She hates guns.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Good, great!</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC: <strong>I do remember seeing the first game as a preview 
though, and finding the developer oddly blasé about the whole concept. 
That wasn’t you was it?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> It wasn’t me, I wasn’t involved. So go bananas!</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> Well, it was just I was asking him all these questions 
about how you’d solved the problems of a first person platformer – the 
lack of peripheral vision, the fact you can’t see your feet, etc. – and 
he just sort of shrugged his shoulders and kept going on about putting a
 little white dot in the middle of the screen.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> That sounds like an imbecile!</p> 
  <p>All: [laughs] </p>

    Mirror’s Edge Catalyst – melee beats guns
   
   
  <p>GC: <strong>He was underselling himself if nothing else, as I imagine dealing with all that is very difficult.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> No, it’s not easy. It’s really, really, hard! 
And I think that’s also the reason we stuck at it. Because moving away 
from it would be the easiest thing. Let’s go third person! Let’s go… I 
won’t mention their names but there are many, many other action games 
that are third person for that exact reason.</p> 
  <p>To us it’s an opportunity to create something that immerses you and
 is it at least trying to solve the problems that you describe. Instead 
of just backing away from it, because we have the opportunity to push 
things forward and try to dare to be different. And to move genres in 
any chosen direction, instead of looking at other games and saying, ‘We 
should do what they do’. Then you have this grind of the same old bald 
space marine doing the same old thing. You know?</p> 
  <p>GC:<strong> I do know, I have to review them all!</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] We also know that sometimes you don’t
 get points for being different. Because different in itself is not a 
quality. And I think that’s also something we hold very true. We’re not 
trying to be different to win an award for being different, because 
that’s just weird. Oh, you get a weird point! To us it’s about bridging 
the gap that you have between what you want it to be and where you are 
today.</p> 
  <p>And trying to get to a new place. Where it is like, ‘Wow, this 
actually works!’ and now we have a new toolset that can maybe take us to
 the next place. Instead of just staying where you are all the time. So 
again, Mirror’s Edge is… I think it is a gift that we’re able to do it 
at all. Because no&nbsp;sane company, and I’m not going to say EA is not
 sane, would put their money on something like this.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>It was a pleasant surprise to hear about.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes, and it’s extremely pleasant for us to be here and show it to you.</p> 
  <p>GC: <strong>Does that imply that DICE now has a reasonable amount of freedom to pitch almost whatever you&nbsp;want?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Yes and no. I think we still have to prove 
what we have to build, but I think we are in a position where we are 
getting much better at proving our point. Because it’s all about 
expression. I have this thing in my head that I need to get you to feel 
what I feel, and I think we are getting pretty good at projecting what 
we want to achieve. Because again, sometimes we have really, really bad 
ideas. So if we can’t pitch it to each other it won’t leave the room. We
 are learning to be better so we can pitch to each other, so that we can
 then create a better idea that we can then pitch to someone else.</p> 
  <p>And also, trusting our instincts. So to me, my gut is my best 
weapon. Because I can react immediately, and I can also adapt to things:
 ‘We should navigate more here, more there’ and then eventually you 
might end up with something that is quite amazing. Looking at Mirror’s 
Edge and Star Wars: Battlefront, coming out of the same studio, being 
built in parallel – and in some cases the same people are involved in 
both projects – I think it’s quite an achievement.</p> 
  <p>GC:&nbsp;<strong>It’s great to see you so&nbsp;enthusiastic&nbsp;about working yourself to the bone.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> [laughs] </p>
  <p>GC: <strong>Well, thanks for your time. It’s always great to speak to you.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>PB:</strong> Great, thank you very much. I love reading the way you write it up.</p>
