Review</h1><div><div></div></div></div>
					
						<p>When it came out in 2007, <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> was a sky blue
 burst in a seemingly endless reality-is-brown wasteland of first-person
 and third-person shooters. Its crisp, clean aesthetic, coupled to a 
solid first-person parkour mechanic and a perfunctory but engaging story
 made it stand out. It wasn’t a game that appealed to everyone, however,
 but for those that got it— that truly understood what it was trying to 
do, <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> stands as one of the best games of its generation.</p>
<p>At first, the idea that there would be a sequel seemed like a 
no-brainer. This was, after all, a game published by EA, and they don’t 
publish things that they can’t turn into annualised sequel-ready 
franchises at the drop of a hat. But then DICE, the game’s developer, 
moved on to other projects and the possibility of another <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> game seemed to get further and further away.</p>
<p>Finally, though, a sequel was first announced in 2014, but then it 
turned out it wouldn’t be a sequel, but rather a reboot, telling the 
story of how Faith Connors came to be where we found her in the first 
game. For fans of the first game, and for anyone who loved its aesthetic
 and what it was trying to do, it’s good to finally be able to get back 
into that high contrast world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rocketchainsaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mirrors-Edge%E2%84%A2-Catalyst_20160609230023.jpg" target="_blank"></a></p><div><a href="http://www.rocketchainsaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mirrors-Edge%E2%84%A2-Catalyst_20160609230023.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Mirrors Edge™ Catalyst 20160609230023 Mirrors Edge Catalyst Review" title="Mirrors Edge Catalyst Review" src="33_files/4c7edd5c-2309-4143-8e54-57eeb5cfc46c.jpg" name="4c7edd5c-2309-4143-8e54-57eeb5cfc46c" class="en-media" width="576" height="324"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Calling <em>Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst</em> a reboot, however, actually 
oversells just how much it relates to the first game. There’s a pivotal 
story moment about halfway through that makes it clear that there is no 
story relationship between the two games, and that the origin story of 
Faith in this game is not the origin story of Faith in the original (for
 that story, go check out the one-shot comic that was published around 
the same time as the first game.)</p>
<p>The story itself is, by far, the biggest disappointment in <em>Catalyst</em>.
 Aside from Faith, almost none of the characters are interesting enough 
to invest in, and Icarus, who serves, I guess, as Faith’s sidekick for 
much of the early story, seems completely out of place with the universe
 he’s in, like he wandered over from the douchebro audience of an EA 
Sports franchise and accidentally got mistaken for the real character. 
Other characters come and go with only surface-level motivations. Nobody
 is complex or interesting.</p>
<p>I kept hoping that things would improve, that I’d see less of Douchey
 McDoucheface, or that someone would come into the story that would make
 me actually care about them. That actually did happen with Plastic, who
 is, aside from Faith, the most interesting single character in the 
game, but she’s limited to a passive voice in your ear for much of it, 
and never leaves her <em>Serial Experiments Lain</em>-inspired apartment.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that everyone speaks this weird camelCase language, 
unironically using words like ‘gridNode’ and ’beatLinked’ and ‘eXec’ and
 urghghghg just make it stop for crying out loud. The only way this 
works is if the game spends more time than it ever does on 
worldbuilding, making us believe that these words and this weird attempt
 at pseudo-Orwellian language is normal in this place. Either that, or 
not take it seriously at all, though that would be significantly out of 
tone with <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>. The only levity we do get is Plastic, 
and its more of the slightly detached computer obsessed teenage girl 
type than the comedy sidekick type.</p>
<p>If the story had been relegated to neat animated cutscenes between 
levels like in the first game, or, hell, if they’d asked Rihanna 
Pratchett to come back and write it, then maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. 
In attempting to distill the world of the first game into something 
purer, something bigger, DICE have accidentally lost the mood and tone 
of that game. Faith, in the first game is strong and caring, and while 
she has her vulnerable moments, she’s clearly shown as being able to 
deal well with them. In <em>Catalyst</em> she’s a lot younger, barely 
out of her teens from the look, but the game badly mishandles the idea 
of a younger, more naïve Faith by taking away the things that make her 
work so well as the protagonist of the original. Maybe its for the best 
that <em>Catalyst</em>’s story is a clean break from the original, because there’s no way I’d buy this Faith growing into the Faith of that game.</p>
<p>The biggest story letdown is the game’s ending, however. I’m not 
going to dive too deeply into it just in case you don’t want it spoiled,
 but suffice to say that it’s a huge letdown that essentially nullifies 
much of the story leading into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rocketchainsaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mirrors-Edge%E2%84%A2-Catalyst_20160609232618.jpg" target="_blank"></a></p><div><a href="http://www.rocketchainsaw.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Mirrors-Edge%E2%84%A2-Catalyst_20160609232618.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Mirrors Edge™ Catalyst 20160609232618 Mirrors Edge Catalyst Review" title="Mirrors Edge Catalyst Review" src="33_files/0521edea-9e0a-481a-af45-e374c8c1a911.jpg" name="0521edea-9e0a-481a-af45-e374c8c1a911" class="en-media" width="576" height="324"></a></div><p></p>
<p>I know the story wasn’t the original game’s strong point, either, but
 at least there it was almost entirely skippable and completely 
separated from the game’s stages. Here, the story is much more a part of
 the game, and while it can be ignored, the biggest change to the 
concept of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> itself means that, eventually, you have to do it.</p>
<p>That big change is the one that almost everybody asked for after the first game came out. “Why isn’t <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> an open-world game?”, “Imagine how cool open-world <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> would be?*”, “Please make the next <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> open world” and so on.</p>
<p>Well, they did, and it is, by far, the best thing about <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em>.
 The downside to it is that it means the level design itself isn’t as 
tightly focused, and there’s no real moments like the crane jump from 
the first game’s third stage, although I’d argue that the final area of <em>Catalyst</em>
 is actually much better than the final area of the original, as you’re 
not required to shoot a bunch of computers to progress through it.</p>

<p>Moving about the open world of <em>Catalyst</em> is wonderful. The 
physics have been tightened up and the game is just a little more 
willing to fudge them in your favour than the first game was. The 
satisfaction of perfectly timed jumps, slides, climbs, quick turns, wall
 runs and all the other tricks Faith can do is still there in full 
effect, and it’s truly the reason to play this game. Being unshackled 
from individual stages means that it’s possible to just free run 
anywhere, any time, without any goal in mind.</p>
<p>There are short side-missions (not to be confused with the game’s 
actual side-story missions) that usually involve carrying a thing from 
one place to another within a very strict time limit. These are the best
 parts of <em>Catalyst</em>, and learning the route and how to make it 
in the time alotted is incredibly satisfying. There’s also a cool 
multiplayer feature where players can create their own courses for other
 players to try and get the best time. This may actually be the best way
 to do multiplayer in a <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> game, and it will hopefully lead to a dedicated online community of course makers within the game.</p>
<p>Even here, though, there is one big problem: A lot of Faith’s 
abilities have been gated behind a progression and levelling system. 
While some of them are just unlocked via XP (which can be earned by 
doing the side stuff, but story missions give the bulk of it), a couple 
of major ones, such as the new grappling hook moves, require certain 
story missions to be completed before they become available. Because of 
the fact that most of these missions’ time limits assume you have most 
of the movement abilities unlocked, doing them before completing the 
story can be an exercise in frustration (it’s possible, but requires 
very perfect execution). Even some of the most basic moves Faith has, 
like the landing roll and quick turn, are initially unavailable.</p>

<p>The combat in <em>Catalyst</em> (and just by saying that I can hear many <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 veterans screaming in pain) is much improved, although there’s still 
far more of it than there should be. Fortunately a lot of it is 
avoidable, but the parts that aren’t are still clunky and weird. Faith 
has been given much better combat options, thankfully, although the 
enemy AI is surprisingly easy to exploit (slide kicks work almost all 
the time). There’s no gunplay at all this time (Faith can’t even pick up
 guns), with the game offering the very *Metal Gear Solid * excuse of 
biometrically-linked weapons. It’s not a big deal because gunplay was 
easily the worst part of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>.</p>
<p>If, like me, you were a huge fan of the design aesthetic of the original <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, then the good news is that <em>Catalyst</em>
 looks even crisper, cleaner and more futuristic than its predecessor. 
The open world design has given DICE the opportunity to provide a lot 
more interiors to move through, which actually helps make the world feel
 more alive, but the ‘just sunshine and blue skies’ feel of the original
 remains. There’s actually a bit more variety, too, with the city being 
broken up into zones that all use slightly different colour schemes. 
It’s a clever way of solving the problem of environmental variation in a
 world where, realistically, everything would be very similar.</p>
<p>For me, one of the most important aspects of the original <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 was its music. Because of that game, I discovered the amazing work of 
artist Solar Fields, who’s ambient electronica has soundtracked much of 
my life since. He’s pretty fantastic if that kind of music is your thing
 and you should go check him out. The game also had the fantastic Still 
Alive by Lisa Mikovsky as its main theme. The good news is that Solar 
Fields has returned for <em>Catalyst</em> and the soundtrack is suitably
 fantastic. This time around the music is dynamically linked to the 
action, which really helps you get focused when you’re running and have a
 good flow going. There’s also a new theme by the band Chvrches that 
doesn’t really hold a candle to Still Alive and feels less a part of the
 game than that song did.</p>

<p><em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> is at once fantastic and 
disappointing. It does some things brilliantly, especially with the way 
world traversal works and its gorgeous aesthetic design. On the other 
hand, the things it does poorly, like the dull story, come close to 
overpowering that good stuff. It’s definitely very hard to recommend 
this game to anyone who wasn’t a big fan of the original. I personally 
loved the first game, and there’s just enough here to keep me interested
 in getting all the little bits and pieces scattered around the map, 
especially now that I can do it without the story getting in the way.</p>
<p>I think that there’s the potential for a brilliant <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> game in the future that has none of the flaws of <em>Catalyst</em>
 or its predecessor. Unfortunately, that isn’t this game, and while I’m 
relatively satisfied with what’s here, I will keep hoping for a 
genuinely great *Mirror’s Edge* title.</p>
