   <h1>Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst – A confident step in the right direction</h1>
   <div>
    <div></div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <p>First-person has become the viewpoint of choice for developers 
trying to make something truly immersive. The action of Halo, the 
intensity of Rainbow Six Siege and the tense escapes of Dying Light owe a
 lot of their impact to keeping you locked in a close-up view of the 
action. But that doesn’t mean it works for every genre. You’d have a 
hard time enjoying a first-person FIFA soccer kickaround with a camera 
view that didn’t let you see your own legs.</p>
  <p></p>
  <div>
   <img alt="mirorsedgecatalyst" src="46_files/c0bb1912-3712-453b-9d89-2ceecb706a3b.jpg" name="c0bb1912-3712-453b-9d89-2ceecb706a3b" class="en-media">
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p>The original Mirror’s Edge divided players as to whether it had 
nailed a new perspective or fallen flat on its face. Some argued that 
its firstperson view gave free-running an essential breath of fresh air,
 with each leap, landing and near-miss having more impact than ever. 
Others dismissed it as a frustrating mess, the restrictions of 
first-person making jumping a tedious exercise in guesswork. How are you
 supposed to judge a leap when you can’t even see your feet? If Catalyst
 never quite solves that problem, it’s more than made up for it with a 
stellar campaign and great open city that make the simple act of 
bounding from rooftop to rooftop a joy. After Dying Light’s baby steps, 
this is a walking, leaping, springboarding advert for the potential of 
first-person parkour in an open world environment.</p>
  <p>Your playground is the futuristic city of Glass, where Faith 
Connors has just been released from Juvenile Hall. Faith immediately 
gets back to work as a Runner, a delivery girl who dashes from rooftop 
to rooftop, carrying packages and trying to avoid the mega corporations 
and law enforcement who generally see Runners as scum. If only they were
 that interesting. The lifeless cast of Catalyst tell a dull, 
overfamiliar tale of corporations controlling the masses, with Faith 
herself getting a clichéd redemption arc that’s missing certain beats 
(you’ll have to buy a tie-in comic to find out why she was in Juvenile 
Hall, as loading screens greedily informed us). Luckily it’s easy to 
look past a forgettable story when the parkour is this good.</p>
  <p>Were it not for review deadlines, we would never have touched fast 
travel. Wall running, leaping and swinging through Glass is 
exhilarating, with first-person making you feel closer to the action 
than watching an avatar pull off similar aerobatics in Assassin’s Creed.
 It’s trickier too, demanding more precision and accurate timing. You’ll
 most likely spend your opening hour introducing Faith’s face to the 
pavement. Short load times and generous checkpoints kept us going at 
first, willing to retry tricky sequences of 
wallrun-jumpgrab-nope-missed-down-we-go over and over. Combinations like
 this eventually become second nature, without ever becoming so easy you
 get complacent. Rooftop layouts are varied, but consistent distances 
between railings and buildings make it easier to judge your leaps every 
time you come across them. It’s not perfect – it can still be hard to 
judge when exactly to make a jump in the heat of the action – and 
detractors of the original may moan it’s barely changed at all. We found
 having to learn every landing in a parkour game refreshing.</p>
  <h2>On the line</h2>
  <p>The best concession is that now Glass is open-world, there’s almost
 always multiple ways to tackle a run. If you’re having trouble nailing a
 tricky series of wallruns, try looking for another way forward. Chances
 are you’ll find one and it might just be quicker, too. Faith can also 
activate ‘Runner Vision’ which highlights a route in red. At first it 
feels cheaty, until you realise it’s only showing you one route to your 
destination, and almost never the fastest one. As your confidence grows 
and you learn your way around Glass, you’ll start running outside the 
red line more and more. It takes a lot of trial and error, but the first
 time you complete a delivery against the clock without even noticing a 
hint of red is glorious.</p>
  <p>Runner Vision can be obtrusive whenever you’re sent indoors. The 
original’s interiors were a huge misstep – claustrophobic corridors that
 were about as free-run friendly as a sledgehammer to the spine. 
Catalyst rips out those cramped misjudgments for bigger indoor spaces, 
more focused tests of the wall running, jumping and climbing we learned 
outside. You can either take it slow, gradually working out the correct 
route, or activate Runner Vision and try for an unbroken sprint to the 
top. The first time we completed a building break-in through intuition 
alone felt fantastic, but so did the time we followed the red route 
through an office chase without once missing a leap. Runner Vision isn’t
 a gamebreaker, it just increases the speed in an action adventure 
that’s all about never breaking your pace.</p>
  <p>It’s a more inspired way of helping players than the unlockable 
gear. The Magrope is essentially a grappling hook that lets Faith swing 
between certain buildings. A later upgrade latches onto grappling points
 and pulls her up. It flows fine with the parkour but lacks the 
precision that on-foot platforming demands. You’re just watching Faith 
being pulled up to a higher point, which lacks the satisfaction of 
getting up there by your own merits. One Magrope upgrade lets Faith pull
 down walls to make new routes and create platforms, but she can’t do 
this while moving. Hardly game-ruining, but we can’t help but feel that 
any gizmo which makes you stop running in Mirror’s Edge feels like a 
step backwards.</p>
  <p>We preferred the Focus system. As long as you keep Faith moving, a 
Focus meter fills up. When goons shoot at Faith, her health will be 
protected, their hits instead draining the Focus meter. It’s an inspired
 addition that rewards you for running from fights. So what moron 
decided to defy it with unskippable fighting sections? Faith can punch 
and kick her way through a fight, in mediocre combat that really doesn’t
 need to be here. You’re supposed to use your parkour skills for more 
powerful hits, like running up a wall and then propelling yourself off 
for a nasty kick to the jaw. That’s fine during the freerunning, but a 
tedious slog whenever you’re trapped in an arena full of grunts. We were
 forced to run around in circles, Benny Hill-style, trying to get enough
 distance to do the leaping attacks and get this trash over with. Why 
not just lose the combat? It’d be A) a more fun game, and B) far easier 
to buy Faith as the hero if she didn’t spend her days booting law 
enforcement off skyscrapers.</p>
  <p>Luckily it’s an infrequent mistake in the main campaign, with side 
quests relegating combat to the last resort it always should’ve been. 
You’ll find these extra missions all over Glass, ranging from 
distracting law enforcement for other Runners to delivering packages 
under tight time limits. They’re a smart way of helping you learn the 
best way to travel through the city. Whenever we failed to get a 
delivery on time, it made us more observant for new routes and 
shortcuts, or tricks we could use to shave seconds off a run. Attempt 
side quests regularly and you’ll soon learn what drops Faith will 
confidently land and which falls will send her kneecaps smashing through
 her jawbone.</p>
  <p>We’re grateful for any work that keeps us sprinting through Glass 
for longer. The game’s shining whites and bright color palette isn’t 
quite as striking in 2016 as it was in the brown-and-grey wasteland that
 was gaming in 2008, but it’s still a striking look that resembles the 
Apple iCity our own doomed civilization is probably hurtling towards. 
Some may find that a little lacking in humanity. Bar the occasional NPC,
 the only people you see while running along the rooftops are being 
beamed out of giant screens or stuck behind thick windows, chatting to 
co-workers and friends, oblivious or uncaring to your presence. We can 
see why that might make the city feel cold, but to us it helped sell 
Faith’s status as an outsider. Free-running with only the sounds of your
 footsteps and the excellent Solar Fields score offers such immersive 
isolation, who needs other people anyway? It’s far longer than the 
original, but doesn’t outstay its welcome thanks to a campaign that 
finds constant clever tests of the core parkour. Varied setpieces are 
also strong, such as a sprint up a rooftop of shattering glass and a 
late game use for the Magrope which is the closest you can get to flying
 without wings. The best sequences might be the skyscraper escapes, 
where the parkour skills you’ve honed to take you to higher ground now 
have to be adjusted for a swift descent. They say you should handle 
heights by never looking down. DICE gleefully remove that option.</p>
  <p>Then there are the moments you inevitably do miss a jump. The fall 
is brutal, the sound of Faith panicking and the wind roaring in your 
ears as the camera refuses to cut away until just before she hits the 
ground. Death is so common in games it’s hard to get a reaction from us 
anymore, but even in Catalyst’s final hours, taking the plunge could 
still illicit a gasp – just another benefit of locking the action in 
first person. Maybe Catalyst is a slightly too conservative sequel to a 
true original, but this open world sequel is still a great step forward.</p>
