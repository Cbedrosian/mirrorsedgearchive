<div>
Don't worry, no spoilers here.
</div>
</div>









<p>Roughly two weeks ago, <i>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</i>hit shelves and 
was met with lukewarm reviews. It has a few shining moments, but most 
critics seem to regard the prequel-reboot hybrid as a disappointment. As
 a rabid fan and proponent of the original, I felt invested in the 
release of a sequel on an emotional level. </p><p>I couldn't get over how refreshing and engaging the original <i>Mirror's Edge</i>
 was, and to this day, it is still one of my favorite video games ever 
released. I would mention it to every gamer I knew, and I still suggest 
it to those who have never experienced it. </p><p>Sadly, <i>Catalyst</i> has me pretty let down. The original game released in 2008 and gained quite the cult status. <i>Mirror's Edge</i>
 illustrated to the masses (via its parkour action) that first person 
shooters didn't have to be all about blockbuster war stories or online 
multiplayer. While it had its flaws, it was a passion project for the 
folks over at DICE as they managed to put a unique and much-needed spin 
on FPS games and platformers. </p><p>On the other hand, <i>Catalyst</i> 
tries to improve upon this cult hit, but it winds up feeling like a game
 crafted from ideas that sound great in theory but not in practice. With
 so-so reviews and somewhat disappointing sales, this franchise might be
 in a bit of danger. What does <i>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</i> do wrong, and is there a future for this franchise in gaming or any other form of media?</p><div>
  <div><img alt="It certainly does LOOK gorgeous." src="15_files/it-certainly-does-look-gorgeous.jpg" name="011a3d87-db1a-4dd8-b48b-4b02b581bf12" class="en-media" width="576" height="324"></div>
  <div>It certainly does LOOK gorgeous.</div>
</div><p>Let's start with the biggest change: the open-world 
environment. Instead of the relatively linear level structure from the 
previous installment, <i>Catalyst</i> lets Faith roam free in the giant metropolis known as the city of Glass. Well, <i>almost</i>
 free. It lets Faith run on the rooftops — most of them. Certain story 
missions can also lead her into unique sections of the map specifically 
designated for those missions. In theory, this sounds like an incredible
 idea: unrestricted parkour-based exploration on the players own terms, 
in a huge and shiny urban playground. </p><p>Unfortunately, Glass's 
rooftops only have three or four ways Faith can utilize to traverse the 
city in any direction. As a result, the story, exploration, and side 
missions will lead the player onto the same few rooftops over and over, 
as they typically provide the ideal paths to navigate the city. This can
 get repetitive, as you'll get used to crossing the same set of jumps to
 get to safe-houses and other locations relevant to the plot. </p><p>Also,
 not every rooftop has a way off that leads in a direction you may want 
to go. You'll find a handful of dead-ends before you reach your 
destinations, in the form of height obstacles and long distances. The 
whole point of an open world is to find your own path as a runner, sure,
 but parkour involves momentum and flow — something the first <i>Mirror's Edge</i> handles quite well. This open-world map, however, only delivers on that occasionally.</p><p> The autonomy of creating your own path as you go sounds great, but it just doesn't <i>feel</i>
 great when you're constantly getting lost. The city is visually 
stunning and is a great backdrop to build a universe in, but it simply 
doesn't provide the sense of flow found in the original as often as it 
should. I can already hear the comments typing, "But, Jonathan, you have
 a map and runner vision to guide you through the city, so how can you 
get lost? You must suck at <i>Mirror's Edge</i>!" Well, you're right. And that's why I play <i>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</i> with runner vision <b>completely turned off </b>— <i>it is the only way for the open world to feel free. </i>Which brings me to the next major flaw: the "new and improved" runner vision.</p><div>
  <div><img alt="Mirror's Edge: Catalyst's new runner vision cues." src="15_files/mirror-s-edge-catalyst-s-new-runner-vision-cues.jpg" name="cab2858b-e605-4e2c-85a6-23c735ce2d1a" class="en-media" width="576" height="324"></div>
  <div>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst's new runner vision cues.</div>
</div><p>"Runner vision" is a system of visual cues within <i>Mirror's Edge</i>
 that help lead the player to their destination — wherever that may be. 
In the original game, objects Faith needed to traverse or doors she 
needed to open would fade from their natural color into a bright, 
saturated red when she approached them. This led the player in the right
 direction if they became confused in regards to where to head next.</p><p>This system returns in <i>Catalyst</i>,
 but with a new tweak — one that defeats the purpose of an open world. 
Now, on top of turning objects red, it comes with a floating red line 
that weaves throughout the environment. It flies over and under 
obstacles, off of ledges, across gaps, all to lead you in the right 
direction. Again, in theory, it doesn't sound all that bad, but it tells
 you EXACTLY where you need to go. It shows each obstacle you need to 
traverse and leaves nothing to the parkour-loving imagination. </p><p>This
 new runner vision is completely incongruous to the concept of an open 
world in a game that is all about the art of traversal. It may guide 
players, but it discourages exploration. You could ignore it, but it 
gets quite distracting. As I mentioned earlier, I disabled runner vision
 from the options menu very early on, but sometimes I'll feel the need 
to turn it back on again just so I can save myself the time and arrive 
at my next mission free of frustration. That is a serious problem. I 
shouldn't want my hand held at all (or want to fast travel) in a game 
all about creatively getting from Point A to Point B. </p><p>The last 
con I'll mention (since this isn't a formal review and I feel a bit too 
harsh) is the lackluster story. There are plenty of characters, events, 
and organizations featured in <i>Catalyst</i>. Characters have lots of 
dialogue, they look great, and the acting is just fine. There are even 
some twists. The game's story, however, ultimately feels unaffecting. 
None of the characters are all that likable, including Faith herself. It
 does have its moments that I won't spoil, but overall it just isn't 
very compelling. I even had a hard time recalling it all, for my own 
sake and the sake of this article. The story is bolstered by the prequel
 comic <i>Mirror's Edge: Exordium</i> — which, as a huge fanboy of the 
property, I happily read — but in the end, it doesn't justify the 
disappointing plot of the game.</p><p>There are things this game does 
incredibly well but not enough to save it from what already looks like 
the process of fading into obscurity. It might be too early to make that
 assumption; after all, even with a huge cult following, it still took 
eight years for <i>Catalyst</i> to release, but that same passionate following doesn't seem to accompany this newest installment. </p><p>As a huge fan — and it kills me to say this — I don't feel very interested in playing another <i>Mirror's Edge</i> after <i>Catalyst</i>
 unless they work out the kinks or price it much cheaper. Regardless of 
what people think of this game in the years to come, I desperately hope 
that <i>Mirror's Edge</i> lives on as a property, if not as a video game franchise.</p><div>

</div><p>The prequel comicwasn't exactly riveting either, but I would 
hate to see the universe this franchise has created disappear. It 
manages to balance a sterile and uncomfortable tone with a modern and 
futuristic one, all while flaunting vibrant and saturated colors in a 
way that very few other franchises do. The environments are absolutely 
stunning. Every corner I turn and every gap I jump leads to yet another 
beautiful metropolitan vista to behold. </p><p>The sleek and colorful 
aesthetic of the city makes for quite visually appealing world. The 
sound design in all the games is also expertly crafted. The music 
straddles the line between ambient and tense, and the sounds of 
footsteps on surfaces and heavy breathing make for an atmospheric and 
truly visceral experience — whether you're standing on the edge of a 
skyscraper or being chased down halls. To put it plainly, the world of <i>Mirror's Edge</i> just looks, feels, and sounds cool. Unfortunately, that isn't enough to make for a fun game.</p><p>Even if <i>Catalyst</i>
 doesn't call for another entry in the gaming world, I hope this 
property lives on. Comics could make a nice home for the franchise, but 
animation sounds even better. Imagine an animated <i>Mirror's Edge</i> 
adventure; the game itself is so visual that it lends itself to a medium
 without audience input like a television show or a film. Cinematic 
adaptations of video games rarely turn out well, but I feel with strong 
writers behind it, this would make an excellent transition to the big 
screen, too. </p><p>Imagine the nerve-wracking stunts and intense chases in a fully realized version of <i>Mirror's Edge's</i>
 colorful world. It would be jaw dropping and, with the right talent, a 
great blockbuster. These are all long shots for sure, but one can dream.
 Ideally, maybe <i>Mirror's Edge </i>could return in the future if 
virtual reality takes off. Another installment could be tailored for VR,
 so that the first-person perspective can really be emphasized (and 
probably make many people sick, but still).</p><p>To clarify, I do enjoy <i>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</i>.
 Not as much as I hoped to, but it is still entertaining and I'll 
probably put more hours into it than most. Maybe the cult following is 
just beginning to spark again. Sales could pick up, and maybe we'll see 
another game in the franchise sooner than I'm assuming. While that is 
unlikely, I hope this isn't the last we see of the <i>Mirror's Edge</i> universe.</p><p><b>What
 did you think of 'Catalyst'? Are you a fan of the original? Where would
 you like to see the franchise live on, if the games don't pan out? Do 
you think 'Mirror's Edge' is the worst thing to ever exist in the 
history of mankind? Maybe you do! Regardless, share your thoughts in the
 comments.</b></p><div>
