  <p>Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst, the upcoming reboot of the Mirror’s Edge 
franchise is set to release in early 2016, and up until now, only one 
short piece of gameplay has been released from <a shape="rect" href="http://eastore.ea.com/" target="_blank">Electronic Arts</a>.
 With developer on the franchise, DICE, working on this fall’s Star Wars
 Battlefront, Mirror’s Edge has been somewhat placed on the back burner 
since its announcement. The game has promised to build on the strengths 
of the 2007 classic, and dispose of what innovations may have been less 
suited in its predecessor.</p> 
  <p>This week, I was given a hands-on session with a pre-alpha build of
 the title, to experience a feel for the game, and some of its 
additions. The build was run on a high end gaming PC, with Windows 7, 
however use of the supplied Xbox One controller was recommended. Before 
we were given access to the game itself, we were sat down to watch an 
eight-minute video, covering some pre-released information on the 
setting, and what the developers envision the final product to include. 
The video emphasized that the game aims to be a beginning of a fresh 
start for the franchise, and while acknowledging the original title, 
plans to build on values not previously explored.</p> 
  <p>The game will take place in the City of Glass, before the events of
 the original Mirror’s Edge game, and show how Faith’s character was 
exposed to the hidden dark side of the controlling corporations, 
changing her view on the city. Kruger Security, led by Gabriel Kruger, 
are told to deal with civilians who fight against the system and take 
those who speak their minds, off the grid. The city is full of 
propaganda, holding a society of brainwashed inhabitants. The runners, 
and a group named 'Black November' with 'terrorist protest methods', are
 the two major factions of rebels, with an intent to bringing back a 
democratic society.</p> 
  <p>The gameplay demo was distinctly split into two sections, starting 
with a short five-minute snippet from the story mode, creating an 
atmosphere and showing the situation Faith is currently in. After this 
small cutscene and tutorial, the demo skipped over to free roam, to 
access three distinct activities in the world.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div>
   <img src="105_files/f73a7e32-27d2-4f5c-87e0-98e6f2dd5e83.jpg" name="f73a7e32-27d2-4f5c-87e0-98e6f2dd5e83" class="en-media">
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>The story begins with Faith leaving holding, and entering the 
outside world. It is stated upon release, Faith must find employment 
within 14 days, otherwise further action shall be taken. Faith still 
shows her confident attitude, with retort towards guards within the 
facility. After exiting the building, she is told to follow the 
designated route through the tight alleyways, and walk towards the bus 
currently waiting. The rain is dripping down the glass buildings, and 
lights in the area produce a visually pleasing flair, seen in most 
recent DICE games, running on the Frostbite 3 engine.</p> 
  <p>After walking through two automatic doors, a red doorway 
contrasting with the white décor is opened, and a new, mysterious 
character attempts to grab your attention. This character claims to be 
working for Noah, a character Faith is close to. The man has previously 
been seen in multiple trailers, and appears to be a key character in the
 storyline. At this point in the game, he appears to be mysterious and 
concealed, but it is likely development of this figure will lead to a 
more established relationship. The character has been seen previously in
 earlier content, wearing a sleeveless hooded leather jacket, and 
sunglasses.</p> 
  <p>You are passed a contact lens, which when placed into the eye, 
presents a heads-up display, with information and propaganda obstructing
 a majority of your view. This is caused by interference produced from a
 device given to Faith by the KSEC guards. Once this is removed, the 
display becomes much more clean, and becomes a key feature for 
displaying in-game information. This display is what shows runners their
 objectives, information and supposedly the runner vision – an iconic 
feature of Mirror’s Edge.</p> 
  <p>The last area of this section was used to learn basic movement 
mechanics, and how to traverse across the urban landscape. The controls 
in Mirror’s Edge: Catalyst have been greatly refined, and focus on two 
styles of movement. It was emphasized that ‘Up Movements’, such as 
jumping, and scrambling up walls are mapped to the left bumper, with 
‘Down Movements’, like sliding and crouching using the left trigger. 
This was a clear an emphasis of the tutorial, and opens the game to less
 experienced players, while still rewarding those with high skill.</p> 
  <p>The original Mirror’s Edge has always been close to my heart, and 
after almost learning the level design off the back of my hand, the 
concept of moving around levels is nothing new to myself. In the build I
 played, the game felt responsive a majority of times, however at 
points, latching onto objects sometimes failed. Unlike the previous 
games, where Faith slightly snapped to key environmental objects, some 
movements require higher precision to grab a hold of. It should also be 
noted that view bobbing has also been massively reduced, and as a result
 feels less dynamic than before.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div>
   <img src="105_files/840f9109-3a99-4db9-b794-7b84671a7802.jpg" name="840f9109-3a99-4db9-b794-7b84671a7802" class="en-media">
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>After getting to grips with the style of play, the game skips 
forwards to a more open map, where I got my hands on the free roam mode,
 newly introduced to Mirror’s Edge. From here, I could use the new map 
system, and plan my routes using the integrated waypoint system.</p> 
  <p>When selecting an area to visit, or to arrive at a start of a 
mission, a waypoint can be set, which you must traverse to. Unlike a 
traditional waypoint system, where a marker is displayed on the HUD, 
certain pieces of the environment are colored red using runner vision, 
indicating the recommended path to take. When followed, this is 
assumedly the most efficient route to take, to arrive at the location.</p> 
  <p>In the demo, three free roam gamemodes were playable, all focusing 
on different features of Mirror’s Edge Catalyst. From the modes shown, 
there was great variety, with objectives available for all styles of 
play. It can be assumed these will be dotted across the entire map, and 
will be side missions to complement the main storyline.</p> 
  <ul><li>Dash is a fast paced gamemode, which pits Faith against a set 
course, aiming for the shortest completion time possible. On the preview
 build, runners from the Mirror’s Edge universe populated leaderboards, 
but it is likely when the game releases, online friends will have their 
scores displayed. A timer is shown in the bottom right while running, 
with a three-star rating based on the time to complete the course. The 
path to take was mapped out to the runner via red arrows on the 
environment. The route I followed took less than one minute to complete,
 and could be restarted after completion with a touch of the 'X' button.</li></ul> 
  <ul><li>Billboard Hack is a more precise, and skill based gamemode, 
where the player must climb a structure, to access a propaganda filled 
billboard. The assets are placed so a linear path is, and acts as a 
puzzle to ascend the building. The building found in demo had a range of
 pipes to clamber and swing from, obstacles to vault, and protruding 
objects to hang from. This is a great way to practice precise puzzles at
 a slow pace, and fully appreciate the sandbox. At the top, Faith 
replaces the propaganda filled board with the runner’s symbol.</li></ul> 
  <ul><li>Delivery mode relies on rapid movements and combat skills, to 
deliver a package. The path to the destination is covered in KSEC 
guards, who are positioned in a way where elaborate movement can result 
in a smooth attack. The demo offered terrain for a variety of attack 
moves, including drops from ledges, front on attacks, and propelling 
from walls onto the enemy. Cinematic attacks have also been implemented,
 rewarding skilled players with more creative moves, in a third person 
perspective. These are a great addition, and don’t stop the dynamic 
action already undergoing.</li></ul> 
  <p>Combat’s focus has most notably shifted, with a focus on 
positioning and approach to the situation, rather than timing and 
precision. The combat has been sped up massively, and expanded with more
 lethal attack options. With the removal of useable guns in Mirrors 
Edge: Catalyst, the close quarters combat has a range of perfectly 
animated attacks, based on the approach of the player. Enemies will 
sometimes take more than one attack to down, depending on the situation.</p> 
  <p></p>

  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>After these missions, I was given a small chance to roam the city, 
and search for packages hidden on the map. In the area playable, there 
were a lot of close quarters walkways, with rooftops being more 
populated and built-up than the first Mirror’s Edge game. Whether this 
was just the area I went to, or representative of the whole map, the 
areas to traverse felt slightly linear, and while many routes were 
available, they still felt pre-planned, with a lack of creative 
movement. The map still appears to be open, and feel alive with a range 
of activities, but the actual free roam still has restrictions.</p> 
  <p>Overall, Mirror's Edge Catalyst is shaping up to become a great 
title, with mechanics which improve on almost all strengths of the 
original game. Small noiances have been removed in Catalyst, and leaves a
 product suited to a majority of franchise fans. The game flows more 
than the previous game, and creates an action-filled cinematic 
experience, significantly faster, and more dynamic. For this entry to be
 successful, a large amount of content must be delivered upon at launch 
with opportunities for all players, regardless of their play styles.</p> 
  <p>Mirror's Edge Catalyst drops on Xbox One, Playstation 4 and PC via 
Origin on February 23, 2016 in the United States, and just two days 
later on February 25, 2016 in Europe.</p>
