  <p>This is the first in a regular series of contributions from Dead 
End Thrills creator Duncan Harris, exploring the art and science of 
gaming’s most historic projects. Lovingly captured galleries of these 
and other games can be found at <a shape="rect" href="http://www.deadendthrills.com/" target="_blank">Dead End Thrills</a>.</p> 
  <p>The best possible reason for a sequel isn’t to build upon success, but to build upon the right kind of failure. <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> is not a great game, but <em>Mirror’s Edge 2</em>
 could be incredible. DICE’s ultra-desirable anti-FPS may have stumbled 
in the execution, but the need for such a game seems more urgent than 
ever. It was an embattled project faced with early Unreal Engine 3 code 
and changing expectations (at EA) of its role. But its bleached and 
blown-out vision of a future surveillance society is perhaps, still, the
 best implementation of Epic’s ubiquitous technology to date.</p> 
  <p>Much of the credit for that belongs to prodigal environment artist <strong>Robert Briscoe</strong>, who this year gave us a masterful remake of thechineseroom’s <em>Dear Esther</em>.
 Clearly a man who thrives upon games where scenery dictates action, he 
has now delivered three of the most memorable venues ever: the 
quietening Hebrides of <em>Esther</em>; The Shard, the sky-piercing mirage at the heart of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>; and the world’s only gorgeous storm drain (<em>Mirror’s Edge</em> again). It’s not the most obvious path for a military hardware specialist to take – but, then again…</p> 
  <p>“I literally didn’t want to see another bloody tank, plane or 
warship again in my life,” he begins, recalling his previous job as a 
modeler for military recognition systems. “One of my friends who worked 
on a mod with me was working on <em>Battlefield: Bad Company</em>, and 
got me the interview at DICE. I was pretty sure I was going to go and 
work on that but, towards the end of the interview, they mentioned this 
new IP coming up. I was sceptical but they were looking for environment 
artists, so I thought it could be all right.”</p> 
  <p>Details were not forthcoming until after Briscoe signed on; <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> was a secretive and risky venture from the outset, something the old demoscene DICE might have dreamt up before <em>Battlefield</em>, EA, and the withering global recession.</p> 
  <h2>“Do we need to go completely white, though?”</h2> 
  <p><em>Mirror’s Edge</em> was “basically just an art test at this 
point, set in Shanghai or somewhere very much like it,” recalls Briscoe.
 “It looked cool, but generic.” There were rooftops, but not until two 
months after Briscoe joined did art director Johannes Soderqvist, 
returning from holiday in Spain, think to plaster them all in, well, 
“this brilliant white plaster you get over there. He took all these 
pictures of it; he was fascinated by the light and the colours bouncing 
around. The clean, fresh look of it.</p> 
  <p>“Another part of it was that some of the 3D artists we had on the 
team tended to just block stuff out really quickly, not put any textures
 on things. And they did these really cool renders of the city, just 
detail models. He loved that as well. So those two things came together 
and that really turned the art direction around.”</p> 
  <p>Briscoe wasn’t quite sold on it, though. “I was sceptical. I was thinking, ‘Yeah, do we need to go completely white, though? <em>That</em>&nbsp;white? Because all I’d seen was just a couple of very small art tests.”</p>

  </div> 
  <p>What’s more, the game was being built using a painfully early incarnation of Unreal Engine 3. Epic’s own <em>Gears Of War</em> was still in production; and it was around this time, you’ll remember, that hasty adopters like <em>Fatal Inertia</em> (Koei), <em>Frame City Killer</em> (Namco) and <em>Too Human</em> (Silicon Knights) stumbled.</p> 
  <p>“We needed to get a better lighting engine because the one we had 
with Unreal was bad,” recalls Briscoe, “Really bad. They hadn’t changed 
it since Unreal 1. We were looking at some of the <em>Gears Of War</em> 
levels at the time – we got hold of some of their source artwork and 
stuff – and they had thousands and thousands of lights in there just to 
simulate bounced light. They were manually placing all of them. And we 
just took one look and everyone was like, ‘There’s no bloody way in hell
 we’re spending two months doing that.’”</p> 
  <p>Help came in the form of rendering company Illuminate Labs, which 
at the time specialised in a Maya renderer – a global illumination 
lighting engine – called Turtle. After lengthy discussions, DICE 
convinced it to port the tech to Unreal as an external renderer called 
Beast (which would later appear in <em>BioShock Infinite</em> and the Starbreeze reboot of <em>Syndicate</em>).</p> 
  <h2>“It was just a case of building the impossible.”</h2> 
  <p>Briscoe had no advanced knowledge of what he’d be working on. 
Artists were assigned to level designers already at work on the maps, 
few of which had much identity. What <em>had</em>&nbsp;stemmed from the 
game’s concept, though – ruthless cops and renegade traceurs in a 
high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse – was a projection of today’s most 
hubristic urban landscapes. “It’s almost over-developed,” says Briscoe. 
“It’s like Dubai and stuff, where you’ve got these amazing buildings 
that are built and then no one occupies them.”</p> 
  <p>And it just so happened that the biggest, proudest and <em>coldest</em>&nbsp;of
 these monuments fell into Briscoe’s lap. The Shard, a dominating 
skyscraper wired into every CCTV camera and affair in the city, was 
actually invented prior to the identically named, visually similar 
project currently underway in London’s Bridge Quarter.</p> 
  <p>“To be fair, it’s an amalgamation of architectural designs and 
stuff that were studied at the time, so there might have been an 
influence in there,” says Briscoe. “But we had this idea of what we 
wanted to do, which was this triangular, almost impossible-looking 
building just to dominate the skyline.” It was a paradox that DICE’s 
level designers, artists and concept artists had to tackle together. 
“Just a case of building the impossible, which is this kind of theme 
throughout it all.”</p> 
  <p>Much the same could be said for <a shape="rect" href="http://the-shard.com/" target="_blank">the London Shard</a>,
 designed by architect Renzo Piano, which early on promised a glazed 
facade much like its virtual predecessor. This has yet to appear, 
however, leaving just a gradually rising spike of exposed cubicles and 
strip lights. The <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> Shard still stands alone.</p> 
  <p>“It was supposed to look like a complete mirror,” notes 
Briscoe.”There’s no real light visible throughout. It would just blend 
into the background – not completely, but like an aberration effect, 
this weird optical illusion of a mirror in the sky.”</p> 
  <p>Thanks to <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s Citadel, The Shard serves a familiar purpose. As an orienteering device, it allows <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 to explore a broad range of times and locations without losing its 
sense of geography. You can see it from just about anywhere in the game –
 and it, you feel, sees all.</p> 
  <p>“It’s just one of the things that <em>Half-Life 2</em> did great, 
giving you this goal from the get-go,” says Briscoe. “You get out onto 
the square and straight away you’ve this huge, ominous, looming /thing/ 
in the background that you know… that’s where shit’s going down later 
on. It’s gives you a goal right away, and that’s what we wanted to with <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>.
 You had this hub where all of the tech was being monitored, where 
everything was being controlled. I don’t know if [DICE] would appreciate
 me saying it was a direct influence, <em>Half-Life 2</em>, but it’s not really deniable.”</p> 
 </div>
 <div> 
  <p>Transitioning between skybox object and local map feature where 
necessary, The Shard is never closer than in Briscoe’s own ‘The Shard’, a
 closing level that finally lets you inside – to see what it sees. 
Serried rows of servers beneath gleaming, vaulted ceilings track the 
movements and histories of an entire population. And then, with nowhere 
left to run to but an abysmal anticlimax of an endgame, the rooftop 
gives you the full, unbroken view of the city at nightfall.</p> 
  <p>“One of the things I really wanted to establish at the beginning of
 that level was to just see this thing before you actually went up to 
it,” explains Briscoe. “It was really important for us to show the 
massive scale of it – in the same way that when you come out on the last
 level of <em>Dear Esther</em>, you see you’re finally at this huge 
mount with the aerial on top. It builds the tension up to a crescendo; 
you know you’re at the final stages.”</p> 
  <p>The rooftop panorama, such a complete 360 that it allows a Bon 
Jovi-worthy helicopter shot to close out the game, would be an 
extraordinary feat of skybox engineering in any game, Unreal-powered or 
not. “The guy who actually made it spent the majority of his life on it,
 I think,” says Briscoe. “It was literally the last year of the project.
 So that’s one of the reasons it looks fantastic.”</p> 
  <p>Another is because it’s not, like most videogame skyboxes, a muddy 
lo-res curtain wrapped sloppily around the map. It looks like a horizon,
 not a stage. Between Valve’s City 17 and the hypnotic coasts of <em>Dear Esther</em>, it might very well be the bridge between Briscoe’s inspiration and his later work.</p> 
  <p>“There was a lot of modelling in there,” he points out. “The thing 
about that rooftop was that it was fairly simple, just this small area 
that didn’t really have the environmental detail of the other rooftop 
levels. It was literally a single rooftop, which meant Chris could just 
go nuts. Most of the budget just went into that skybox alone. You can’t 
do that for every game, but it’s about getting this balance. It’s about 
putting the same amount of effort into the foreground as the 
background.”</p> 
  <p>That the events on that rooftop are a split-second flurry of 
unmitigated tosh is hard to deny. It’s Briscoe’s “biggest regret,” in 
fact, “that there was so much effort put into it by me, the level 
designer and the backdrop artist. We built up this huge gameplay 
scenario that was going to happen where you’d be chased around by all 
these guys and have to chase this helicopter around, then kick this guy 
out at the right time. But it got cut at the last minute.”</p> 
  <h2>“What the hell have they been eating over there?”</h2> 
  <p>Briscoe’s other level in <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> is arguably more 
powerful than even The Shard, staged around and throughout a quite 
awesome storm drain. Furthermore, unlike The Shard, this one is very 
much rooted in reality.</p> 
  <p>G-Cans – or, to give it a somehow less glamorous name, the 
Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel – is a distinctly 
Japanese vanity project designed to protect Tokyo from flooding during 
the monsoon season. Costing $2bn and home to over 100km of tunnels, it 
lures in urban adventurers from around the world to see its ‘Underground
 Temple’, a cavernous pillared storage tank literally dripping with 
atmosphere.</p> 
  <p>Most recently it appeared in the egregiously repetitive survival horror game <em>Fragile</em>,
 the saving grace of which was a funereal parade of such places linked 
by a story of post-apocalyptic companionship. Being a Wii game, though, <em>Fragile</em>
 can only imply what Briscoe’s version delights in: the unique behaviour
 of light in a place recently visited by water. Again, it’s not hard to 
draw parallels with <em>Dear Esther</em>’s refurbished Cave level.</p> 
  <p>“Me and the level designer were just brainstorming ideas and were 
literally looking at stuff – architecture – from Tokyo, Korea, 
Shanghai…” says Briscoe. “And one of my mates just sent me one of these 
images of this huge… You know, the shot with the pillars.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div>
   <img src="123_files/8cd08cb1-2f75-466b-a4e7-ef65c7b369c1.jpg" name="8cd08cb1-2f75-466b-a4e7-ef65c7b369c1" class="en-media">
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>“I was like, ‘What the fuck is it? <em>What is it?</em>’ And he 
said it was a sewer. And I said, ‘What the hell have they been eating 
over there? Is it that bad?’ It took us a while to find out what the 
name of the bloody thing was, but we found it and it was like, ‘That has
 <em>got</em>&nbsp;to go in.’ It really speaks to the kind of weird, 
semi-futuristic architecture that was in the game at the time. And the 
other opportunity it presented was really good vertical gameplay within 
an indoor environment. We could get a really good feeling of vertigo but
 not have it be an office building or something boring like that.</p> 
  <p>“And, as an artist, for me it was just brilliant. It was something I
 knew I’d just love to work on. So, we belted out some ideas. It took a 
long time to get some gameplay together for that, just because it’s such
 a big room. But it was a bit of creative twisting of reality in there, 
with all the scaffolding and stuff. That was one area of the game that I
 worked on that I was really pleased with in the end.”</p> 
  <p>These levels weren’t just blank canvases for the artists, either. 
Briscoe and his colleagues would join their allotted level designers to 
find a timeline of levels with broad mechanical, if not visual, themes. 
“I think level two started out as this big hole in the ground that you 
travelled down into, going through all these tunnels and stuff. But 
there wasn’t any real predefined thing before we started building.”</p> 
  <p>Something else that threatens to literally strike you in the storm drain are the walls and floor: they’re beautifully textured. <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 owes much of its endurance to the fact that it’s not another 
‘consolitis’-afflicted charnel house of compressed and neglected 
surfaces. It’s immaculate, just like its city.</p> 
  <p>“The secret of that was that we had these basically monochrome 
textures. We could get away with a lot because it’s mostly just black 
and white,” says Briscoe. “And, in a similar way to <em>Dear Esther</em>,
 you’ve not necessarily got detailed textures but this perceived detail,
 this impression, which is what’s really important. We could do small 
tricks like having high-res normal maps but a low-res diffuse map which 
didn’t have much detail on, but you could get away with it because of 
the normal map. And of course a lot of areas were really bright, 
slightly blown out, so again you’re hiding it.</p> 
  <p>“A lot of textures were reused as well because they’re so basic. 
All the building textures, we just reused them all over the place 
because we didn’t have to worry about different material types. We 
didn’t have to worry about concrete not being the right colour for 
concrete, or enamel not being enamel. In a lot of places it was just 
plain white textures – there wasn’t even a diffuse used. And we used a 
lot of tricks <em>in</em>&nbsp;the textures, even going as far as to use one channel of the actual diffuse for the specular, another for the alpha.”</p> 
  <p>It’s these little tricks and shortcuts – knowing when to use new 
and expensive techniques versus old, cheap ones – that have separated 
the good and the ugly of the last ten years. Trapped within the same 
console hardware for approaching seven of them, games have progressed 
through reduction and economy. <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, a game defined by almost hyper-realistic lighting, got it right first time, choosing baked static lighting throughout.</p> 
  <p>“A lot of people don’t realise that if you ever use dynamic shadows
 or lighting, that’s a massive, massive chunk of memory gone straight 
away. Because you have to render the whole scene to an uncompressed, 
huge texture. So we had that extra memory there,” explains Briscoe.</p> 
 </div>
 <div> 
  <p>“We also did a lot more work on putting detail into the actual 
polygons, rather than the textures themselves, which is a philosophy 
I’ve taken away with me. Vertices on a model cost nothing; mesh memory 
is nothing compared to texture memory. And you see in a lot of games 
they have these flat walls with air ducts and things, and they’re just 
normal maps. I just think, why not just model it? It’s a hell of a lot 
cheaper and it’ll look a hell of a lot better up close.</p> 
  <p>“And you see these other games that have normal maps on every 
single surface, so you’ve got a grass texture which looks like porridge 
because you don’t need a normal map on grass. You can’t do it, it 
doesn’t work. So we used normal maps and specularity quite sparingly 
where we could, and that’s something I took over to <em>Dear Esther</em>. The only level I really extensively used normal maps in was the Cave level.”</p> 
  <p>Briscoe is “really irked” by this stuff, and it’s not hard to see 
why. Games with beautifully high-res diffuse textures and tiny normal 
maps are just one example of such crass optimisation, others simply 
misspending their budgets and basically vomiting the results in your 
face. Briscoe suggests we call it “the <em>Skyrim</em> effect,” though surely there’s a better ring to simply ‘the <em>Mass Effect</em>’.</p> 
  <p>“I hate to use the word but it tends to be what I’d call 
‘consolitis’. It’s a bit of a swearword, but it’s people not putting 
enough effort into the console version. They’ve just lowered their 
texture resolution to fit it in memory. Or you find a paint bucket that 
has a really high-resolution normal and specular map, and you think: 
why? It’s a bucket. It’s about consistency, giving priority to what 
needs decent textures and what doesn’t.”</p> 
  <h2>“It wasn’t really my cup of tea.”</h2> 
  <p>The worst you can say about <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> is that it’s 
simply not very good, or that it’s simply brilliant or awful. It’s too 
complex a scenario for any of that, its flaws residing in the molecular 
chemistry of its pacing, signposting, innovative POV and accompanying 
control scheme. Well, <em>most</em>&nbsp;of its flaws are that subtle. Then there are the cutscenes.</p> 
  <p>Briscoe howls, “Oh, don’t tell me about those. <em>Honestly</em>. 
We couldn’t really believe it when we got those back. I was opposed to 
the whole idea of these e-surance style animations in the first place. I
 think they just thought to outsource the animation because it <em>could</em>&nbsp;be
 a really cool thing. It could look really different. But it just turned
 out to be, ‘What the fuck?’ I don’t think there’s a single person on 
that team who’ll say those are cool.</p> 
  <p>“It’s a total contrast to the actual game, and not in a good way. 
It’s like you’re watching Game Of Thrones and a commercial for Kellogg’s
 Frosties comes on. ‘That’s it, I’m getting a cup of tea.’</p> 
  <p>“Early on in the game we had these prototype cutscenes which were 
all firstperson. Completely firstperson: a little bit like the ending 
cutscene but a lot more choreographed, a lot more polished. It was 
really amazing. But I think it was just a case of time. We had to get 
out and compete, for some reason, with <em>Gears Of War 2</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>,
 and all these other titles that were coming out. All these sequels. We 
were pushed and pushed and pushed, and more and more stuff had to be 
cut.”</p>

  <strong>Level designer and 3D environment artist Robert Briscoe. <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> breathtaking skybox</strong>
  <p></p> 
  <p>This is <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> in a nutshell, really. Green-lit as 
part of a bold new IP drive by EA chairman John Riccitiello – “they used
 to call him ‘JR’” – it was suddenly a bit <em>too</em>&nbsp;bold for the company’s bean counters. That nasty habit of maximising sales rather than concept, to which we owe <em>Dead Space 2</em>’s
 incongruous multiplayer mode, became something of a personality 
disorder for DICE’s ultra-niche platformer – and it was contagious.</p> 
  <p>“There was this pressure to deliver within a short amount of time 
because it was costing a lot of money,” reveals Briscoe, “and again it 
was a huge risk. And I think it was a case of nobody being really sure 
what they were capable of in the time that they had. There were 
decisions made that were just questionable. Me and the level designer 
would sit there and get a level looking really good, and the next day 
you’d come in and there’d be snipers everywhere. People wanted it more 
intense, not really seeing the bigger picture of pacing and stuff like 
that.</p> 
  <p>“So, it wasn’t really my cup of tea when it came out. I sat down 
and played it on PS3 for about an hour and that was it, I gave up. 
Didn’t like it. There were all these gameplay decisions going on that I 
wasn’t happy with, but as an artist it was like, ‘Well, I’ve got no 
control over that so I’m just going to make it as good looking a game as
 I can.’ And, luckily, the art designers and level designers were some 
of the best I’ve worked with.”</p> 
  <p>There was, furthermore, a tension right at the heart of what <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 involves: free-running… or should that be parkour? Was this a game 
about pondering the environment (arguably the former) or beating it 
(arguably the latter)? Was it open world or linear time trial? Was it, 
ultimately, the game DICE imagined from the start?</p> 
  <p>“The open world thing was something we really wanted to do, one of 
the early things we kind of dreamed about doing,” says Briscoe. “But it 
became obvious early on that it just – as far as getting it on the 
consoles was concerned – wasn’t going to be possible. One of the first 
things we had to do was just tackle the Unreal Engine, because no one in
 the company had really worked with it before. But towards the end we 
really got this solid engine together. If it had kept going and if 
they’d kept working on <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, it could have easily gone
 in [an open world] direction. It’s just a case of what our original 
goals were and what we could actually achieve. They were separated 
towards the end.”</p> 
  <p>Rumours perpetually swirl of that <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> sequel – and why not? DICE must be furiously itching to do something non-<em>Battlefield</em>;
 the first game is nothing if not a costly R&amp;D project; and what 
better sophomore project for Frostbite 2 than a masterpiece of outdoor 
lighting? Just how much petitioning does it take?</p> 
  <p>Briscoe confirms “there were rumours going around, so it’s fair to 
say people were thinking about it. All of these issues were up there as 
some of the most important to be addressed if it was going any further 
in the future. I can say without giving too much away that the plans 
were to improve it a lot more in those areas. You would have got more of
 an open game, a lot more choices. I have literally no idea what’s 
happening now. I heard it might be getting resurrected but nothing 
official.”</p> 
  <h2>“We need to go back to the drawing board…”</h2> 
  <p>Drop-kicking the villainous Jackknife out of a helicopter and into 
gaming’s hall of eternal shame – right next door to the last half-hour 
of <em>BioShock</em> – wasn’t the last of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, sequel
 or no sequel. A series of unlockable Time Trial levels sought to purify
 the game somewhat, turning it into a more appetising sport. It was a 
half-measure, though, as much an attempt to recover abandoned level 
designs, recycle existing ones, and add something – anything – to the 
meagre few hours of singleplayer story.&nbsp;Then this happened…</p> 
  <p>“At the end the project, <em>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</em> was entering crunch time and the whole team went to either that or <em>Battlefield 3</em>,”
 recalls Briscoe. “So most of the team went off and was dissolved 
between those two. But EA wanted DLC from the get-go, because it was 
really kicking off and making loads of money. That was where a lot of 
the revenue could come in.</p> 
  <p>“We had two or three level designers, if that, and one artist: me. 
At least at first. And I was like, ‘Okay. So, you want me to make seven 
time trial maps on a similar scale to some of the other levels which 
took one artist two years to make. And you want me to do it in three 
months?’ I think it was even less. I just said to Johannes, “Look, it’s 
not going to happen, it’s just impossible. We need to go back to the 
drawing board a bit here and just think about doing something in the 
spirit of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, but a lot simpler.”</p> 
  <p>The result, Pure, is extraordinary. It’s just <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>
 heroine Faith, essentially, dropped into the centrifuge of Briscoe’s 
imagination. Story and reality are separated and removed, leaving 
textures, geometry and light. It is the unlikeliest of art games, made 
in guerilla fashion by one of the biggest studios in the world. 
Demoscene stuff, you might say. Classic DICE.</p> 
  <p>“We had the training level in the game already, this huge room with
 just blocks and stuff. So we talked about doing this whole thing of 
maybe having arenas like that. But again it had to be cut down because 
there just weren’t the resources to design and build these rooms. So 
Johannes went away for a while and thought about it, and we talked it 
over with [the <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>] concept artist,&nbsp;Pierre 
Hannah. And he came up with a few sketches of this weird, abstract 
landscape. I loved it. It was perfect.</p> 
  <p>“We had this idea of just themes for each level. One was pure 
cubes, another was obtuse angles and conflicting geometry, and another 
was just streamline geometry – curves and things like that. We basically
 invented this material that could just be used on brushwork in the 
game, to apply textures without worrying about alignment or anything; it
 would just fit. I think it was probably one of the coolest things I’ve 
worked on.”</p> 
  <p>Briscoe’s memories of <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> remind us, like the 
game itself, that game appreciation is not an exact science. There are 
no metrics for the people who buy games like <em>Rage</em> (Briscoe: “Don’t even get me started on that”), <em>Mass Effect</em> and even <em>ArmA</em>
 for something other than the critical path. To a great many, DICE’s 
game is a work of art. To Rob Briscoe, the time he spent on it made him 
what he is today.</p> 
  <p>“DICE has a massive bar that they like to stick to,” he says. “The 
quality consistency is a very important thing over there. They just 
won’t release something unless they’re… I think <em>Battlefield 3</em> 
was in its third iteration of Frostbite 2 when I was there, and there 
were two other iterations by the time I’d left. The art directors there 
are, without a doubt, some of the most talented I’ve seen, and the 
artists are also amazing. I was absolutely out of my depth when I went 
there.</p> 
  <p>“‘What the hell am I doing?’ I thought. ‘I’ve got all these amazing
 people around me.’ But being around that quality and talent really 
drives you to do better and improve yourself. One of the things I’ve 
learned is that is you slack out on one element – if you can’t be 
bothered with the skybox; if you just want to make everything look great
 <em>from a distance</em>… I’d have trouble going back to a company that has different philosophies on those things.”</p>
