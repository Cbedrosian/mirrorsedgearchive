<body class="ennote" ><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>Let's talk about your game soundtrack debut&nbsp;<em>Mirror's Edge.&nbsp;</em>Why did you decide to work on game music? How did you get to work on this particular project?<br clear="none"></p><div><div><strong>Magnus Birgersson:&nbsp;</strong>It was the Audio Director [Magnus Walterstad] for&nbsp;<em>Mirror’s Edge</em>&nbsp;at
 DICE who phoned me and asked if I was Magnus Birgersson, the man behind
 Solar Fields. He sent some concept art, but I still didn’t know what 
the game was about or anything and they asked me to audiolize the 
concept art to see if I ‘heard’ the same things he did while looking at 
the images. After he got the results, he said it was a perfect match and
 after some months I got invited to the DICE offices in Stockholm and I 
got a short briefing on the project. In September 2007, I started to 
work full time on the music for&nbsp;<em>Mirror’s Edge</em>.</div><p><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp;Writing
 solo music and working on a soundtrack that will accompay existing 
imagery are two very different things. Were there any significant 
artistic and technical differences from your solo work? What were the 
terms and requirements have you got from EA and DICE? With what 
materials did the developers provide you with?</p><p><strong>Magnus Birgersson:&nbsp;</strong>I
 got the complete manuscript, concept art and play through videos. DICE 
provided me with a lot of detailed information about each level, the 
characters and the story. Since I wrote the music in my studio in 
Gothenburg, I had to travel to Stockholm a couple of times to see how 
everything was coming together and make sure that the music and the game
 worked together as well as possible. Me and the Audio Director were in 
touch almost every day during the music production. On my visits to DICE
 in Stockholm I met the level designers and we played through the levels
 and we talked about how the music should feel. We tested the music with
 the game, trying out each level to see if we should trigger calmer 
music, more intense music, or maybe complete silence. I’ve seen&nbsp;<em>Mirror’s Edge</em>&nbsp;in action from the very early stages up to the final version.</p><p>If
 I was to compare this process to writing music for my own albums, it’s 
like night and day. I had to rethink my way of composing since I didn’t 
have the same linear structure to rely on, compared to when I am 
composing for Solar Fields.</p><p><img src="120_files/00b9f237-28af-44e9-ba47-8ea580ff3b67.jpg" name="00b9f237-28af-44e9-ba47-8ea580ff3b67" class="en-media"></p><p>It
 was also a huge challenge for me - there was a lot of music that had to
 be created during a short period of time. Finding out how to capture 
the feeling of Faith [<em>Mirror's Edge</em>'s protagonist] and the 
story and reflect that in the music was quite challenging. Another 
challenge was to get the music to play seamlessly in the game and get 
the music to interact with the player. The idea for the music was that 
there should be no gaps while playing, which meant I had to compose all 
parts for each level so that they would work together even if there was a
 tempo change or a different chord structure. Since there are so many 
different sounding parts in each level that reflect Faith’s mood, it was
 a big effort to get these parts to work together smoothly. The goal was
 that the player wouldn't hear the changes between the different parts 
and rather feel the musical changes. The result is fantastic, but it was
 quite tricky to get it to work as we wanted.</p><p>I wrote around 150 
minutes of music in total. The main scoring took 4-5 months, and after 
that I did some polishing and edits to align the music with changes in 
the game. Each level has its own theme and feeling that reflects the 
mood of Faith and the game play. I'm very happy to say that I got 100% 
creative freedom to do what I wanted. Of course there was a structure 
that I had to follow, for example we had different categories for each 
level, such as ambiences / puzzles / chases / combats. Other than that I
 had total freedom, and from the response I got up till today I think I 
added a lot of identity to the score and the game.</p><p><strong>Michael:&nbsp;</strong>So far,&nbsp;<em>Mirror's Edge&nbsp;</em>is
 your only game soundtrack. Do you plan to continue working on games, or
 do you currently have any game projects in the making?</p><p><strong>Magnus Birgersson:&nbsp;</strong>Until recently, I've been busy finishing my 11th Solar Fields album called&nbsp;<em>Random Frida</em>y.
 The album was released in April, after that there will be some touring 
and then we'll see ;) Due to NDAs, I cant talk about any projects, but 
you will definitely hear more music in games from me.</p><p><a href="http://www.game-ost.com/articles.php?id=288&amp;action=view">http://www.game-ost.com/articles.php?id=288&amp;action=view</a><br clear="none"></p><hr><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>Reviews</strong></span></div><div><h4>Overview</h4><p><em>Mirror's Edge</em>&nbsp;is
 a truly brilliant, often transcendent game, and its electronic score is
 a major component of the immersive experience. The game experience 
"unlocks" various bits and pieces of the tracks created for the 
soundtrack. However, the digital album release itself is the only way to
 experience the tracks in their entirety and also in exceptional 
clarity.</p><h4>Body</h4><p>"Introduction" provides the first taste of 
the electronic excellent to expect from the soundtrack. It draws 
listeners into the world of&nbsp;<em>Mirror's Edge</em>&nbsp;near 
completely, both in the game and as a retrospective stand-alone 
experience. "Edge &amp; Flight" thereafter takes minds on a much deeper 
journey. The ultra-radiant yet striking cold soundscape of the 
introductory segment befits the atmosphere of the featured city. The 
absorption rate only magnifies as the track transitions into the theme 
for the first level, moving between ethereal and turbulent sections 
before culminating in a truly awe-inspiring climax at 4:53.</p><p>"Pirandello
 Kruger" excels in both originality and emotional connection. It opens 
with a somber, somewhat desperate phrase that is truly distressing and 
touching, then gradually picks up into the "combat" section before 
rolling into an exceptional synth section at about four minutes in. 
"Shard," certainly one of the album's strongest and most memorable 
tracks, opens with another transcendent section that relays hope and the
 sense that the mission is finally almost over, culminating in a driving
 beat that maintains its pace through the rescue of the protagonist's 
sister.</p><p>At the end of the soundtrack, the "moneymaker" — the vocal
 track "Still Alive" — takes hold. This is a well-sung and memorable 
song in its own right, featuring gorgeous piano backing and the 
beautiful voice of Lisa Miskovsky. Although more mainstream than the 
instrumental tracks, it still fits and ends the game and soundtrack 
well. Listeners also should note that a maxi single and remixes EP were 
also released dedicated to this song.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>All things 
considered, if Joe Techno had heard this soundtrack in its entirety even
 in the absence of any knowledge or awareness of the game, I believe 
that he would find it to be thoroughly excellent nonetheless; original, 
fresh, and, above all, emotionally impacting electronic bliss. The 
game's imagery, however, does indeed provide the perfect backdrop for it
 all, and the two go hand-in-hand exactly as intended.</p><p><br clear="none"></p><p><a href="http://www.game-ost.com/albums/2330/mirror's_edge_original_videogame_score/">http://www.game-ost.com/albums/2330/mirror's_edge_original_videogame_score/</a><br clear="none"></p></div><hr><p><strong>OSV:&nbsp;</strong>What were your favourite, and least favourite, aspects of writing the music for<em>Mirror’s Edge</em>?<br clear="none"></p><p><strong>Solar Fields:&nbsp;</strong>Hmm,
 let’s see, seriously only good things. First of all it was great fun to
 work on this project and that’s the key for it all. The project was 
super interesting; I was following the game from the very beginning to 
the final product. It was a huge challenge for me to do this since this 
was my first “big” work in this area. I had to rethink my whole way of 
composing since I had to keep the story, feelings and environments in 
mind during the composing period.</p><p><a href="http://www.originalsoundversion.com/one-musician-to-another-solar-fields-interview/">http://www.originalsoundversion.com/one-musician-to-another-solar-fields-interview/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br clear="none"></p><p><br clear="none"></p></div></body></html>
