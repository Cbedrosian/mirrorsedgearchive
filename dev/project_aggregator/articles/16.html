<p>Gamescom kicks off today, and we spent time gearing up for the big 
show chatting with EA executive vice president Patrick Soderlund about a
 host of topics. You may have already seen that <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/08/16/ea-strongly-hints-that-mass-effect-games-will-get-remastered.aspx" target="_blank">EA has reversed its stance on remasters</a>,
 and is actively discussing jumping into the fray (possibly with Mass 
Effect games on the docket). We also discussed the changing face of the 
console market, fan projects, Mirror's Edge, and major changes to how 
players will experience the Battlefield franchise.</p>
<p><strong>Having Faith in Mirror's Edge&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>One of EA's tentpole titles for the year was also one of its 
riskiest. Mirror's Edge attained cult status last generation with a 
loyal, vocal fanbase that had been clamoring for more. Depending on who 
you ask, this year's prequel, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, either sprinted 
across the rooftops of success or plummeted to the streets below in 
failure. It was a polarizing game, but Soderlund is still happy with how
 things turned out.</p>
<p>"For us, if you look now that the game's been out for a while, 
reflecting on it, I still think it's really good that we decided to 
build it," he said. "I'm for the most part pleased with the game as it 
came out. I'm happy that we stayed true to the art direction and kept 
that, but kind of evolved it so that it looked and felt good. I think 
the city as it was designed was cool. I think it was a very ambitious 
project for many reasons. We got criticized a little bit for a weak 
story. It's difficult to tell a story in any medium. I think we also 
wanted to make the game open and more free-flowing than the first one 
was. At any point in time when you make any piece of entertainment, 
people give feedback and we have to listen. We have to listen to what 
people liked and what they were not so happy with and things that they 
outright rejected and learn from that."</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat tepid critical response, it's too early to count
 Mirror's Edge out. Soderlund says it's far to early to know what will 
happen to the franchise.</p>
<p>"[Are we] going to build another Mirror's Edge in the future? I don't
 know yet," he candidly told me. "We are early on in the lifetime of 
that game. We're going to have to look at this maybe seven or eight 
months from now with the lens of the brand itself, what fans said, and 
in my role, overall performance from a financial perspective. We have 
the responsibility to ourselves and our shareholders. It's a combination
 of many things. Frankly, I think most importantly it is what's the 
desire of the game team, and where do they want to take it or do 
something else. I've done this for so long now that without a passionate
 game team wanting to build something, you can't get a good product. We 
have a passionate development team that really wanted to build this. I 
think they gave it their all. Are there things that we would have done 
differently or changed? That's always the case."</p>

<p><strong>Where Star Wars Business and Fandom Intersect</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, a fan group called Frontwire Games stepped forward
 with a game similar to Star Wars Battlefront called Galaxy in Turmoil. 
After going public, the group quickly discovered that deciding to use 
iconic Star Wars locations and vehicles wasn't as simple has artists 
putting X-Wings into a game.</p>
<p>Lucasfilm stepped in and informed Frontwire that the nascent studio <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/07/31/lucasfilm-uses-legal-force-to-quash-star-wars-battlefront-knock-off.aspx" target="_blank">would not be permitted</a> to use the Star Wars license. The result was that EA took heat for an alleged role in <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/08/01/frontwire-studios-plots-future-for-its-battlefront-game-stripped-of-star-wars.aspx" target="_blank">forcing the Galaxy in Turmoil team to move away from AT-ATs and Y-Wings</a>.</p>
<p>The situation is far more complex than that, with EA having paid an 
undisclosed large sum to Lucasfilm parent Disney for exclusive rights to
 create core audience games based on Star Wars. While Soderlund had no 
involvement with the Frontwire situation, he did share his thoughts on 
fan projects and why this one couldn't continue.</p>
<p>"What I would say is that we've seen back in the day with Battlefield
 1942, we had a bunch of mods that truly helped people become aware of 
Battlefield as a brand and associate a lot of good things with it," he 
said. "We saw the Desert Combat mod. We saw several World War II and 
even a World War I mod that we played and enjoyed. The community of 
people out there that are passionate about adding to something in 
existence is, in general, a good thing. I see no badness from that. That
 stems from passion and desire to build."</p>
<p>The difference here is that the fan project wasn't building on 
Battlefield, Need for Speed, Dragon's Age, or any other wholly owned EA 
property. It was based on one of the biggest franchises in the world.</p>
<p>"It's a lot easier for us to make decisions for brands that we fully 
own. When it comes to something as big and well-known as Star Wars, 
there are so many other parts that come into play," Soderlund explains. 
"What is considered canon? What can you do within the brand? It becomes 
very complicated. On top of that, between Disney and EA is a substantial
 business deal where one partner has paid the other a lot of money to 
gain exclusivity. Without knowing details of exactly what happened, 
that's kind of how I look at it in general."</p>
<p>Despite Frontwire having to shift gears and abandon the use of Star 
Wars assets, Soderlund believes there is an important place in the 
ecosystem for mods and iterative design. In fact, that is where he got 
his start.</p>
<p>"I grew up from that myself. We started building mods and ideas based
 on other games that were in the market," he said. "Battlefield 1942 
came about because we were playing a lot of Doom at the time and said, 
'This is cool, but wouldn't it be cool if you could be in this 
first-person view, but outside and in vehicles.' I totally get that, and
 this passion should not be chilled by any company."</p>

<p><strong>Neo, Scorpio, and the Changing Console Landscape</strong></p>
<p>The game console world is about to undergo a major shift. For decades
 now, we've become used to the idea of generational divide. When a new 
console emerges, it replaces the one before it. Often old software is 
abandoned completely, forcing players to start their libraries anew with
 every new hardware purchase.</p>
<p>With Microsoft's upcoming Project Scorpio and Sony's 
not-quite-announced PlayStation Neo, gaming hardware will abandon 
traditional generational design. Instead, the ecosystem for current 
consoles will grow with content being forward compatible. In the case of
 Project Scorpio, we know that accessories will be forward compatible, 
also. Soderlund was open about how this shift will impact EA's business.
 The company is ready and eager for iterative design.</p>
<p>"I believe that it's an interesting approach," he told me. "We 
haven't seen this whole idea of upgrading since the Mega CD in 1991 or 
something. At the time, that might not have worked, but this is 
different. I can only comment to what's been announced by Microsoft, the
 whole idea of keeping the ecosystem intact and scaleable is right. If 
you get in later in the cycle, you can get a Scorpio or you can upgrade 
to it. It's an interesting, smart approach, and we'll see how well it 
works. It's something that we as a company are 100 percent behind. I got
 super excited when I saw what they are working on, and without giving 
you any information, the same is true of Sony. In general, this is a 
good thing."</p>
<p>Soderlund believes that giving developers more power will open the 
door for different types of gaming experiences. With PlayStation VR on 
the horizon and Microsoft mentioning VR in its debut announcement for 
Scorpio, head-mounted displays are entering the living room. Whether 
it's designing for VR or pursuing traditional development, Soderlund 
says that Frostbite makes iterative console hardware an easy 
proposition.</p>
<p>"From a technical and developer perspective, it's actually really 
straightforward for us," he explained. "We have an engine in Frostbite 
that is dynamic and scaleable. It's an engine that today supports 
substantially all known PC platforms and DirectX 9, 10, 11, 12. Given 
that these machines are almost PC architecture inside of them, they are 
not that difficult for us to develop for. Scaling up and down is 
something we're in a good position for. If you're a developer, when you 
make games, you always want more capacity. You always want to bring more
 to the players. We're truly excited about this."</p>
<p>The opportunity also comes with challenges, though. Simply offering 
improved resolution is easy. Given current consoles' PC-like 
architecture, it's an approachable problem. The tricky part comes when 
developers will have to decide how else they want to use that power.</p>
<p>"If you were to run a Battlefield or some of our other PC games today
 and you run them in ultra high definition resolution, you can run them 
in 4K. You can run Battlefield 4 in 4K with the right spec," Soderlund 
said. "That's a resolution impact, and that's meaningful. But then you 
get to choose what to use the horsepower on. Do you want more players in
 multiplayer? Do you want a deeper A.I. system? Do you want a more 
advanced physics system? Do you want more stuff going on on the screen 
at the same time? That's where it gets a little tricky, because we have 
to start making decisions. The game teams will have to start making 
decisions about what matters most to them. But the notion of an Xbox 
ecosystem or a PlayStation ecosystem that keeps growing and gets bigger 
and bigger is important for us. Even if we come to a point where we're 
seeing increased development costs as a result of that, hopefully the 
added install base is going to solve that."</p>

<p><strong>Battlefield Becomes a Platform</strong></p>
<p>In July, EA announced that Battlefield is going to be overhauled on 
current-generation systems and PC. A new framework will allow players to
 squad up and stay together across game modes and different Battlefield 
games. This effectively creates a Battlefield "platform" from which fans
 can launch multiple games, track career stats, and more. Some of what 
Soderlund explained sounds like Halo Waypoint with a bit more oomph.</p>
<p>It also creates some interesting possibilities for EA down the line. 
The company owns the technology that's being built for Battlefield, and 
it's being developed by the group that created Battlelog. I asked 
Soderlund if he sees a future in which EA's sports games might operate 
with a similar platform framework. The answer? It depends on what fans 
want.</p>
<p>"For us, it's going to be about understanding how this works," he 
said. "It needs to be player focused. If the players are telling us they
 like it, then we'll keep updating and working on it and it's a way to 
swap between games? Why wouldn't we bring it to other parts of the 
business. Whenever you do something new and something that hasn't been 
done for, you wonder if it will work. When I play around with it, it 
makes a lot of sense."</p>

<p><strong>A Return to Nintendo Isn't Out Of The Question</strong></p>
<p>EA was one of many publishers that bid farewell to the Wii U early on
 in the ill-fate console's life cycle. With Nintendo about to shift 
gears and announce a new system of its own, it's a clean slate for 
bringing third-parties back to the table. Because Nintendo hasn't 
formally explained what its next system, codenamed NX, will be, 
Soderlund couldn't talk specifically. However, he did share thoughts on 
Nintendo and what would bring the company back to the table.</p>
<p>"Nintendo is such an instrumental part of our whole industry," he 
shared. "They deserve to be successful, and they deserve to be a major 
player in the business, given their pedigree. It's not only the machines
 that they've built, but also the IPs they've brought to market. There 
are very few companies like Nintendo. Whenever they bring something to 
market that we see an addressable market for, we'll be there. Given that
 they haven't announced [a new console] officially or shown it, I can't 
comment specifically."</p></div></div>
