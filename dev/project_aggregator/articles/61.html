     <div> 
      <p>Today, the Conglomerate rules the nation of Cascadia. But long 
before the corporations took their shared place on the throne, a nation 
called OmniStat once rose from the Regression, the Civil War divided 
OmniStat into three parts, of which Cascadia was one, and the November 
Riots propelled the Conglomerate to power.</p> 
      <p>It’s safe to say that Cascadia holds a lot of history, and in 
this post you’ll get to read all about the pivotal events that shaped 
the entire nation and the city you’ll experience in Mirror’s Edge™ 
Catalyst.</p>

     <div> 
      <p><b>The Rise of OmniStat</b></p> 
      <p>Out of the Regression rose&nbsp;OmniStat. Inspired by tales of 
ancient utopias and classless societies where every citizen had equal 
value and production was owned and shared by all, OmniStat quickly 
swallowed up the majority of the isolated settlements and surviving 
cities – sometimes peacefully, sometimes not. Some refused to 
acknowledge the OmniStat way of life and resisted to the bitter end, 
causing much strife and paranoia within OmniStat itself as the rulers 
were forced to accept that not everybody was ready to blindly embrace 
their vaunted ideas of the perfect state.</p> 
      <p>They reacted with increased control, to the point that all 
citizens were surveyed by the authorities, and each other, all the time.
 OmniStat soon became a merciless tyranny perpetuated by The Party and 
its ruling elite in their fevered struggle to centralize and control 
everything and everyone.&nbsp;</p>

      </div> 
      
     <div> 
      <p><b>The Kruger Uprising</b></p> 
      <p>One of the ancient clans, the Kruger family, accepted OmniStat 
rule but made sure to secure important positions within the Party as it 
grew. However, they never truly accepted the Party line and the 
philosophy it was founded on, and as the decades passed they began 
plotting drastic change – believing that for civilization to truly move 
forward a radically different society had to be formed, one based on 
free enterprise and individual achievement.</p> 
      <p>Always wary of betrayal, the Krugers still managed to gather a 
few other powerful families to their cause – some were prominent party 
members, and others held important industrial positions. When the flames
 of rebellion and civil war finally engulfed OmniStat, the Kruger family
 and their allies were at the forefront of the struggle.</p> 
     </div>

      </div> 
      
     <div> 
      <p><b>The Civil War</b></p> 
      <p>Decades of accumulated hate and frustration helped turn the 
flames into a devastating conflagration and soon OmniStat was torn apart
 in a bitter civil war. The fighting lasted for years and the leading 
families were forced to acknowledge that theirs was not the only vision 
of an ideal society. There were others who also saw these turbulent 
times as an opportunity to set up their own societies, and when the dust
 eventually settled three nations formed from the ashes of what was once
 the most powerful civilization on the planet.</p> 
      <p><b>OmniStat Divided</b></p> 
      <p>As the war ended, the OmniStat rulers grudgingly acknowledged 
that much of their once vast nation remained only in the historical 
records. A peace conference was called, attended by the leaders of the 
three main factions that had formed during the war.</p> 
      <p>It was agreed that OmniStat would be split in three: The 
largest part would still be OmniStat and remain under Party rule; the 
second largest was to become Cascadia – shaped by the families 
supporting the initial Kruger Uprising; finally there was Sabaeus, a 
secretive and secluded nation founded on a strict religious faith and 
ruled by clerics.</p> 
      <p>A fragile and tentative cease-fire was agreed upon and borders 
drawn up. Tensions remain high to this day though, and many claims and 
counterclaims were never properly satisfied. Few believed in a lasting 
peace.</p>

     <div> 
      <p><b>The Founding</b></p> 
      <p>The original vision of Cascadia was a nation founded on 
democratic principles, where individuality and initiative was to be 
encouraged and rewarded. However, Cascadia’s founding was off to a 
flawed start, as the families involved in the uprising had less 
altruistic intentions. The democratic principles were only vaguely 
converted into actual law and the nation grew on an insecure foundation 
as the system favored those who had already secured vast assets during 
the chaotic war. With voting rights curtailed from the outset, and with 
several of the old families not ready to share their accumulated power, 
the first steps down the road to tyranny had already been taken.</p>

     <div> 
      <p><b>Rise of the Corporate Houses</b></p> 
      <p>A deep fear and hatred of OmniStat and the Party drove a 
nation-wide initiative to eradicate the old and rebuild anew. Statues 
were built, honoring values such as freedom and initiative, as well as 
the Original Twelve – the heads of the families that had supported the 
Kruger Uprising.</p> 
      <p>Within a decade those same families controlled almost 80% of 
the “free” market, and their dominance kept growing. Oligarchies between
 them formed and fell apart, and all the while the Cascadian Assembly 
struggled to create laws that would limit corporate control. But with 
most Assemblymen belonging to one of the families the laws remained 
toothless.</p> 
      <p>The families became known as the Corporate Houses and their 
opulence and wealth knew no bounds. Cascadian society eventually 
stratified into three distinct castes: the loCaste eking out a meager 
existence in the Greylands, the midCaste trapped in an eternal rat-race 
in the growing cities, and the hiCaste enjoying a detached existence at 
the top of the pyramid.</p>

      <p><b>The Conglomerate</b></p> 
      <p>The Conglomerate was born when the twelve major Corporate 
Houses joined together with the intent of mutually shaping the future of
 Cascadia. Their internal rivalry remained to some extent though, and it
 was decided that only nine would sit on the Conglomerate Board at any 
one time, depending on their respective market shares. This was intended
 to still foster some competition between them and make sure 
they&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;stagnate completely.</p> 
      <p>The formation did not go unopposed. For years the discontent 
had grown among the general populace to the point that open protests 
were held against the worsening work environments, declining social 
conditions and rapidly increasing corporate encroachment on the elected 
government. The issue was debated for months on end in the Cascadian 
Assembly, but only toothless statements ever came out of the 
discussions.</p>

      </div> 
      
     <div> 
      <p><b>The November Riots</b></p> 
      <p>As the Conglomerate grew in power tensions grew with it, and 
different protest movements came and went until one of them, based on 
pacifistic ideals, took root and spread quickly. It found its strongest 
supporters in Glass where it had also been founded, and on a cold 
November day, a hundred thousand demonstrators marched on Zephyr 
Station. There they gathered to listen to speeches and protester songs. 
But something went terribly wrong and some protesters began acting 
violently. Shots were fired and within moments the peaceful gathering 
had turned into a rioting stampede. For three days the riots raged 
unabated and Glass burned.</p> 
      <p>In the end the authorities prevailed, the riots were culled and
 those responsible (who still lived) were rounded up. The original
