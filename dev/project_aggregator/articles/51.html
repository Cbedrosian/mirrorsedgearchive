      <h4><em><strong>How did DICE become DICE as we know it today? </strong></em></h4> 
      <strong>I</strong>t started with a demogroup of 5 students who were developing 
      <em>Amiga</em> games in 1988 in their spare time and released their first big game, 
      <em>Pinball Dreams</em>, in 1992. We actually still have pinball machines in the studio to remind us where it all began! We were originally named '
      <em>Digital Illusions</em>' and eventually tacked on '
      <em>Creative Entertainment</em>' - that's where DICE comes from. The company grew as it was merged with fellow Swedish developer, 
      <em>Refraction Games</em>, in the early 2000s. The next game we developed that gained a significant following was 
      <em>Codename Eagle</em>, but the first major game we released was 
      <em>Battlefield 1942</em>. That game established us as a AAA studio and it was the beginning of a big hit series as we went on to make over a dozen 
      <em>Battlefield</em> games in the years that would follow. Outside of the 
      <em>Battlefield</em> series, 
      <em>Mirror's Edge</em> was released in 2008, and we made 
      <em>Star Wars Battlefront</em> last year. We're now in the process of completing 
      <em>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</em>.

      <h4><em><strong>So what is Mirror's Edge Catalyst all about?<br clear="none"><br clear="none"></strong></em>This
 game puts the player in the shoes of the young runner from the first 
game, Faith Connors. She's essentially a messenger/courier who takes 
part in corporate espionage in the city of Glass. When the player takes 
over and starts playing as Faith, she's just been released from juvie 
and one of the early missions that she takes part of begins pretty 
standard but proves to be far more complex. Through that particular 
incident, she realizes that this beautiful façade [the city of Glass] 
can be stripped away relatively quickly and beneath it is this much more
 sinister underbelly being run by a number of corporations... But that's
 all I'm going to tell you! Players can find out the rest for 
themselves.</h4>

      <h4><em><strong>In the first Mirror's Edge game, we didn't get to know Faith Connors much. Does Catalyst build up on that? <br clear="none"><br clear="none"></strong></em>Catalyst
 is a reboot of the first Mirror's Edge game, so it doesn't really build
 on the story from the original. When we initially decided to make 
Mirrors' Edge Catalyst, we looked at the original game and asked 
ourselves what was strong about it. Upon closer inspection, we 
established that Faith was that key element. The character, the gameplay
 in terms of movement, the art direction and the audio - the four 
pillars - were what had made the first game a success. Our narrative 
director Christofer Emgård has built this fantastically rich world where
 Faith is the center but there's so much more happening around her in 
terms of story, world and supporting characters.</h4>

     <div> 
      <p><em><strong>What are some of the new elements that help us get to know Faith?</strong></em> <br clear="none"><br clear="none">With
 Catalyst, we wanted the players to connect more with Faith so we moved 
away from the 2D cutscenes that you see in the first game and opted for 
realistic motion-captured cutscenes created&nbsp;with Maya and 
MotionBuilder. This level of realism and intimacy helps the player 
better relate to Faith, as we see her expressions, her emotions, 
everything that makes her strong. One of the tricky parts of making a 
first person game with a strong character is that you don't see yourself
 [the character.] So we ensured that the player would be able to see a 
lot of themselves throughout the game via reflections. By seeming 
themselves in reflective surfaces, they'll constantly be reminded that 
they're this strong character and unlike the first game, Faith Connors 
will feel extremely present.</p>

      <p><em><strong>The one thing that always comes up when discussing 
Mirror's Edge is the unique and clean look of the world. It's completely
 different in contrast to the gritty and cluttered environments most 
games portray. How did the city of Glass and its stark aesthetic come 
about? <br clear="none"><br clear="none"></strong></em>We reflected on 
the look of the first game - it boasted this beautiful white world and 
it was distinct and very unique in its appearance. It was hard for us to
 break down what made it look beautiful, so we started listing keywords 
to describe it. The word "elegant" stuck early on, and through 
association, elegance became minimalism, and minimalism is something 
that is very controlled. Control is a major theme in the game's 
totalitarian world, so for us, it all fit together. We stripped down as 
much detail as possible in efforts to make everything in the world 
essential to the game, important and relevant to the player. We feel 
that this aspect makes it feel unique in contrast to other games, which 
tend to put in as much details as possible to fill up the environments.</p>

   <div> 
    <div> 
     <div> 
      <p><em><strong>What was most challenging in developing a reboot? How do you still keep it fresh the second time around?</strong></em> <br clear="none"><br clear="none">It
 takes a lot of thought process and understanding of shapes and forms 
and how they relate to one another to decide what makes a certain prop 
or a character look good.&nbsp; And this was the true challenge - 
keeping that signature clean look consistent throughout the game. <br clear="none"><br clear="none">We
 wanted to create a world that was rich, bigger, and that you can do 
much more in. We wanted to give the player a better understanding of 
Faith's power and capabilities by strengthening the storytelling, giving
 them a better sense of this totalitarian world. We played on the idea 
that looks could be deceiving - the more you look at this world, the 
more you realize it's not all nice and it's actually quite hostile. We 
wanted to give the players a fresh experience, so we've created this 
massive city where they can run free, giving them more freedom to play 
and more room to explore. The other way we switched it up was by adding 
new elements to the game, for example, the Social Play function which 
allows players to compete against one another.</p>

      <h4><strong><em>What are you most proud of upon completing the development of Mirror's Edge Catalyst?</em> <br clear="none"><br clear="none"></strong>Just
 being able to get everything together was a huge feat for us, seeing 
all the awesome parts come together to build that experience we intended
 to build from the get-go. It looks amazing, the audio is amazing - we 
managed to build a very auteur style of game that drastically differs 
from what's out there. The team was probably the most fascinating aspect
 of all this. Seeing them come together to build a super innovative game
 while overcoming a number of challenges together, despite the many 
moving parts.</h4>

      <p><em><strong>We've seen you pull through time and time again so 
we're no surprised! A lot of studios stick to developing one type of 
game. We've noticed that isn't the case for DICE. How do you keep your 
games so diverse yet successful? <br clear="none"><br clear="none"></strong></em>That
 comes down to the talent that we have at the studio. The Mirror's Edge 
series is DICE's passion project, which allows us to push the design, 
art and gameplay boundaries that we set on ourselves for our other 
franchises. At DICE, we always maintain that underdog mentality despite 
the fact that we probably are one of the biggest studios in the world 
right now. We're always looking for something that's going to be more 
fun, interesting, and innovative that we can push forward. <br clear="none"><br clear="none">I
 think that's how we keep tons of diversity in our series. We also have a
 pretty wide array of backgrounds and disciplines in our studio team 
that in of itself brings a lot of different flavor to the table. The 
level of experience varies from fresh-out-of-school juniors to very
