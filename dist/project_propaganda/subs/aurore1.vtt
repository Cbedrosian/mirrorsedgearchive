00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.100
Hello, I'm Aurore Lupain-Tanner,
and this is Glass Daily News.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.680
The ongoing de-escalation
talks with OmniStat

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.560
-reached a definite stalemate today,
with neither side willing to give ground.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
Cascadian diplomats expressed severe
frustration with what they described as

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.520
-"typical OmniStat bullheadedness",
while OmniStat itself declined to comment.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.560
Tensions have been rising steadily
along the border for the past six months

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.520
-with KrugerDef responding
to a sudden OmniStat troop buildup.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.280
One senior KrugerDef officer voiced
his growing concern saying that:

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.280
"All it takes now is a single spark and
this thing will explode in our faces".

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.940
The Conglomerate board urges calm, saying
that: "Every possible effort is being made

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.040
-to resolve this situation in a peaceful
manner and should this prove impossible,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.120
-we are well prepared to face any OmniStat aggression".

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.240
In Glass; Gabriel Kruger, CEO of KrugerSec,
has launched a new employ safety

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.420
-initiative, focusing on hitherto secluded
rooftop worlds of our beautiful city.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.860
KrugerSec is assembling several security hubs there, in order to increase their presence all over the city.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.980
"We've been seeing an increase in policy
breaking activity on the rooftops lately,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.200
and we aim to nip this in the bud before
the situation gets out of hand", said Kruger

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.640
-and continued: "The end result will be a safer and sounder city where all employs can thrive in peace".

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.840
The Bryson board yesterday decided to terminate the contract with Stetson Unger,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.540
-a senior eXec with their HR divison.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.420
Unger, whose fast rise to eXec level was
hailed by Bryson as a prime example of

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.800
-employ upward mobility, was burdened with the
full accountability for the Greyland megaFactory

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.820
-explosion last month, which killed
25 lowCaste employs, and injured 65 more.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.180
Mr. Unger has declined to comment.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.360
With the imminent launch of Reflection,
MMG has produced a series of programs,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.440
-taking a close look at this new groundbreaking
technology, and how it will affect our daily lives.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.400
A retrospective will look into the history
of both Reflection and Silvine Systems,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.640
-and we will host several panels discussing
the amazing implications moving forward.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.280
Employs all over Cascadia are keeping
a close watch on Glass ever since

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.580
-we were chosen to be the proving ground.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.660
A rare opportunity to get a taste of
the future before everyone else.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.640
Finally, in what some describe as the
most intense match of the season, Glass

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.200
-beat Cascadia Prime 10 to 9
in this weekend's game.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.960
The first two quarters were all about positioning
and even posturing, with players on both teams

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.040
-performing amazing feats.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.140
But the real action started in the third quarter
when Glass broke out of the fold and took a

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.700
-solid lead closely followed by Cascadia Prime
who almost caught up in the end.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.960
Accolades go to Oscar Frederick and Martin Cold,
who both scored several times.
